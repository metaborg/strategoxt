Description: 

  The stratego-front package contains tools and definitions for the
  Stratego syntax. It defines the Stratego syntax in SDF. These SDF
  definitions are used to generate algebraic signatures that define 
  the Stratego abstract syntax. Stratego-front adds support for 
  concrete syntax to the basic Stratego compiler.
