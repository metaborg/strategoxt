	* trans/sdf2ast-conflicts.str: separate tool for producing a list
	of conflict information from an SDF syntax
	definition. Currently, the only conflict information that is
	produced is a SubtermConflict.

	* trans/sdf2parenthesize.str: use the separate sdf2ast-conflicts
	tool.

	* trans/sdf2parenthesize.str: produce more Stratego compiler
	friendly output: for every constructor/pos there is now only a
	single rewrite rule. This rewrite rule checks for a conflicting
	subterm in the where clause. This reduces the number of generated
	rules, the LOC, and it doesn't blow up the compile-match
	component.

	* trans/sdf2ast-conflicts.str: fixed a major bug in the generation
	of rewrite rules for chain priorities. I was assuming that the SDF
	normalizer generates chain priorities for the transitive closure
	of the priorities that are defined in an SDF syntax
	definition. For example,

	----------------------------------------------------
	  context-free priorities
	      Exp "*" Exp -> Exp
            > Exp "+" Exp -> Exp
            > Exp "<" Exp -> Exp 	
	----------------------------------------------------

	will not result in a chain priority 

	----------------------------------------------------
	  Exp "*" Exp -> Exp
        > Exp "<" Exp -> Exp
	----------------------------------------------------

	sdf2parenthesize now takes the transitive closure itself, and
	generates all the required rules for chain priorities.

	This bug was revealed by pretty-printing the GNU Classpath source
	code with the pretty-printer of java-front, which uses the
	sdf2parenthesize tools for printing parentheses.

	* trans/sdf2parenthesize.str: new tool to generate a Stratego
	transformation tool that adds the necessary parentheses to an
	abstract syntax tree. The information is obtained from an SDF
	syntax definition.

	For example, if Plus is declared to left associative, then the
	following rule will be generated:

	----------------------------------------------------
	ExpParenthesize :
	  Plus(q_15, Plus(o_15, p_15))
	    ->
	  Plus(q_15, Parenthetical(Plus(o_15, p_15)))
	----------------------------------------------------

	A relative priority related example:
	----------------------------------------------------
	ExpParenthesize :
          Mul(Plus(v_2, w_2), u_2)
	    ->
	  Mul(Parenthetical(Plus(v_2, w_2)), u_2)

	ExpParenthesize :
	  Mul(t_2, Plus(v_2, w_2))
	    ->
	  Mul(t_2, Parenthetical(Plus(v_2, w_2)))
	----------------------------------------------------

	The tool supports:
	o relative priorities
	  --------------------------------------------------
	      Exp "&&"  Exp -> Exp
	  >   Exp "||"  Exp -> Exp
	  --------------------------------------------------
	
	o groups of associative productions
	  --------------------------------------------------
	    {left:
	      Exp "*" Exp -> Exp
	      Exp "/" Exp -> Exp
	    } 
	  > {left:
	      Exp "+" Exp -> Exp
	      Exp "-" Exp -> Exp
	    }
	  --------------------------------------------------

	o Associativity attributes: non-assoc, assoc, left, right.
	  --------------------------------------------------
	    Exp "+"   Exp -> Exp  {left, cons("Plus")}
	  --------------------------------------------------

	o Kernel SDF associativities
	  --------------------------------------------------
	    prod1 assoc prod2
	  --------------------------------------------------

	To be honest, this is all support because the SDF normalizer is
	applied ;) .

	Does this solve all the parentheses related problems? No,
	unfortunately not. The tool does not support {prefer} attributes,
	which are for example used in the dangling else problem.

	So, if you want to make sure that IfThenElse(_, IfThen(_, _, _),
	_) is pretty-printed correctly as:

	--------------------------------------------------
	if a then (if b then c) else d
	--------------------------------------------------

	then you still need to implement this be hand. I don't have a clue
	how I could automate this in the generator, since the {prefer}
	attributes are not really declarative.

	Bug reports are welcome.

	* trans/sdf-spread-cons.str: new tool to annotate all equivalent
	productions with a constructor, if one of them has a
	constructor. Not really monkey proof at the moment, but well,
	Stratego users are no monkeys!

2004-05-01  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf: Kodak Moment! This was the sdf.cons pp-table, def and
	.tbl (AKA SDF variant 3). They are no longer used.
	
2004-05-01  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Updated to most recent SDF:
	- sdf-doc
	- sdf-wf
	- sdf2sg
	- sdf-bracket
	- sdf2asdf
	- fdl2sdf
	- sdf2sdf
	- sdf-regularize
	- sdf-imports

2004-04-23  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf-cons/sdf-cons.str: upgraded to new SDF syntax.
	
2004-04-20  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf-bracket/sdf-bracket.str:
	- removed GPL license.
	- don't remove the top level term if it is not the accepted
	grammar identifier (sdf 2.1)
	
2004-02-24  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf-normalize/*: removed.

2004-02-24  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* analyse/parse-unit/*: parse-unit now supports wildcards in the
	specifications of expected results in a testsuite. In error
	message they appear as "_", which is somewhat poor.

2004-02-22   Merijn de Jonge  <mdejonge@cs.uu.nl>

	* Makefile.am: added autoxt.m4 to EXTRA_DIST

	* Makefile.am: added line: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I . such that
	autoreconf can find autoxt.m4

2004-02-19  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/gen-renamed-sdf-module.str: since we are now using the
	constructors of the SDF2 syntax definition in PGEN 2.0 it is
	possible to implode the AsFix result of the sdf normalizer instead
	of a yield followed by a parse. This is major performance
	improvement. implodePT is used because the output of the
	normalizer is AsFix2ME.

2004-02-18  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.str: now parses sdf modules using the new
	SDF2 syntax definition of pgen 2.0. 

2004-02-15  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* analyse/parse-unit/*: added [ ] delimiters for test input. This
	is useful for testing typical string literals in programming
	languages. Writing many double quotes is not very attractive in
	this case.

	* analyse/parse-unit/*: the test description is now optional. In
	this case the test input will be shown as the description (or the
	file name if the input is a file). 

	Example of testsuite without descriptions:
	----------------------------------------------------
	testsuite Java Expressions
	topsort Expr

	test "1 + 2" -> Plus(Int("1), Int("2))
	
	test "1++2" fails
	
        test "6*7" succeeds
	----------------------------------------------------


2004-02-15  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* analyse/parse-unit/*: designed a concrete syntax for parse-unit
	testsuites. Parse-unit is now ready for the technology push.

	Example:
	----------------------------------------------------
	testsuite RTG nonterminals
	topsort NonTerm

	test Primitive string
	  "<string>" -> string

	test Primitive string
	  "String" -> plain("String")

	test Quoted non terminal 1
	  "[Bla]"  -> nonterm(quoted([chars("Bla")]))

	test Quoted non terminal 1
	  "[Bl]a]" fails

	test Quoted non terminal 1
	  "[Bl]a]" succeeds
	----------------------------------------------------

	The concrete syntax does not require escaping and that's very
	convenient in typical parse-testsuites. Instead of escaping
	special characters you just write more double quotes if your test
	involves double quotes. Descriptions of tests and testsuite are
	terminated by an newline. Wildcards are allowed in the syntax, but
	are not supported in the implementation. Implementing wildcards in
	parse-unit is a to do.

2004-02-13  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/gen-renamed-sdf-module.str: a simple collect over the AST
	of an SDF definition is not really correct: the definition might
	contain modules with renamings and aliases.

	The generator now invokes the sdf normalizer in pgen before
	collecting the sorts. This is very expensive (especially because
	the resulting AsFix is yielded to a string followed by a parse),
	but this is n0t really a problem for such a generator. The result
	is that the generator can now handle all sdf constructs. You can
	for example rename a module that is itself a renamer as well. How
	useful.

2004-02-12  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/gen-renamed-sdf-module.str: tool to generate a RenamedLang
	module, which renames all sorts in an SDF syntax definition to
	more unique names. Such a module is typically used in syntax
	definitions for concrete syntax. Such modules are boring to write,
	so they should be generated.

	The tool accept a --scheme flag. The value of this flag must be an
	ATerm list, with Var(_)s and ATerm Strings. This scheme is used to
	generate the renamed sort names.

	--prefix Name is sugar for --scheme [Name, Var("Sort")]

	Example:
	gen-renamed-sdf-module -i Java.def \
	    --name Java-Prefixed --import Java \
	    --scheme "[\"Java\", Var(\"Sort\")]"

	Yes, yes, the scheme option is ridiculous ;) .

2004-02-04  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/parse-unit/parse-unit.str: parse unit now fails with exit
	code 1 if one of the tests fails.

2004-02-01  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/parse-unit/parse-unit.str: binary output for sglr and
	implode-asfix is *much* faster. It also solves a problem in the
	aterm library with reading text files: ATreadFromFile returns a
	segmentation fault after reading about 500 files. Binary aterms
	don't have this problem for some reason.

2003-12-05  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.str: support multiple output formts using
	the -of (or --output-format) flag. By default pack-sdf from now
	returns an SDF definition in concrete syntax (-of txt). Other
	supported output formats are asfix and ast.

	Note that tools must use the new Makefile.xt. Bootstrapped source
	distributions that include Makefile.xt will only install because
	the .defs are already included. If this file is removed the
	package will also need the updated Makefile.xt.
	
2003-12-05  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.str: refactored the entry point (no
	asfix/text/ast changes yet)

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.str: sdf module not found is now a fatal
	error. Execution is thus terminated if a module is not available
	in the include path.

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.str: be silent if there is nothing to say:
	"including" messages are only shown if verbosity is 1.

2003-05-27  Merijn de Jonge  <M.de.Jonge@tue.nl>

	* tohtml-sdf: minor modifucation due to change in tohtml tool

2003-02-28  Martin Bravenboer  <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Moved pretty-print table from src/sdf to pp. Renamed to Sdf2.pp

	* xtc/parse-sdf-module: XTC tool to parse SDF module

	* syn/*.sdf using constructors (to be refactored)

	* xtc/pp-sdf.str: XTC tool to pp SDF AST to text

	* xtc/sdf2text.str: XTC part of sdf2text shell script

2003-01-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf2sdf/sdf2sdf.str: Reverse order of tools produced
	by specified-tools

2003-01-01  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf-bench/Makefile.am: runbm.str does compile any more
	because of the stricter use-def analysis in sc. Since the program
	seems to be obsolete anyway (does anyone use it?), it is not in
	the build anymore. If still useful it should be modernized. There
	are probably much better ways to do this now.

2002-12-13  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/sdf2sdf/sdf2sdf.str: Using xtc instead of gt-paths

2002-12-08  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

2002-09-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/pack-sdf/pack-sdf.r: Changed pack-sdf to fail if one or more
	of the modules are not found. The names of missing modules are
