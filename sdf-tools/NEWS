Version 0.2 released: 2001-11-29
	* Tools adapted for new versions of sglr/pgen.
	* Added support for grammar identifier checking.
	* runbm: re-added -n switch (it is supported by sglr again).
	* sdf-regularize.r: Recognize groups of productions that can be
	  expressed by means of a regular expression. Assumptions: (1) all
	  productions for a sort are in one context-free syntax section (2)
	  all productions are available.  Sorts representing regular
	  expressions are replaced by these expressions to improve the
	  abstract syntax of the language (no superfluous injections).

Version 0.1 released: 2001-09-20
	* This package contains the sdf tools extracted from the
	  Grammar Tools package, version 0.7.
	* The -g option of sdf-imports now generates GraphXML output
          (was import graph format).
	* The sdf-wf tool accepts new switches:
	    -e       to treat warnings as errors
	    --short  to produce an abbreviated well-formedness report
	* All `unglued' tools, i.e. those that require a front- or backend,
	  are now installed in libexec.
