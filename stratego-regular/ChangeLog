2004-04-30  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* sdf2rtg: Improved support for non-trivial regular
	expressions. Stuff like optional alternatives is now supported.
	
2004-04-29  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: implemeted for
	seq. Thanks to Arthur, who is fond of using less used
	functionality ;) .

	* pp/rtg.pp: pretty printing of tuple terms.

	* trans/sig/stratego-rtg.str: mapping of RTG tuples to Stratego.
	
2004-04-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/sig/core-sig-apply-param-sorts: a tool for removing
	parameterized sorts from a Stratego specification. The tool
	specializes all the constructors of a parameterized sort to the
	actual parameters that are used for this sort.

	* trans/sig/core-sig2rtg: resurrected on request of Niels. The
	rules of rtg2sig and sig2rtg is now defined together in
	stratego-rtg.str

	* xtc/sig2rtg: resurrected. It now applies
	core-sig-apply-param-sorts before passing the specification to
	core-sig2rtg. sig2rtg now uses pack-stratego instead of strc
	--ast.

	* pp/rtg.pp: fix in the pretty-print of tuples.

2004-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>
	
	* Solved bug in bracket ignore strategies

	* Added simple cycle detection in sdf2rtg

	* Ignore injections from syntax sort into context-free syntax
	sort.

2004-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* The List and Opt non-terminals are now history. Removed from
	syntax, signatures and tools.
	
2004-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* The built-in opt and list non-terminals are no longer used. They
	have been replaced by several built-in terminals: Cons, Conc, Nil,
	Some, and None. RTGs generated from SDF definitions are now quite
	ugly, but very precise. SDF2RTG now generates signatures that
	specify that a list needs to have at least one element for
	example. sdf2rtg from now uses the SDF normalizer of PGEN. This
	means that it supports all the SDF stuff such as renamings,
	aliases, and so on. I've test support for the more advanced SDF
	features using the Stratego-Java syntax definition.

2004-03-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* More fixes for accepting the output of the pgen sdf
	normalizer.
	
2004-03-21  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/interpret/*: implemented interpretation of an ATerm
	against an RTG.

	* xtc/format-check.str: format check an ATerm against an RTG. The
	old wf-checker is no longer available.

	* xtc/aterm2irtg.str: returns an IRTG given an RTG and an ATerm.
	
2004-03-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Rewritten core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str to concrete syntax for
	RTG. Very attractive. I should use concrete syntax for SDF there
	as well.

	* Added an embedding of RTG in Stratego.

	* All languages (RTG, RHG and regexp) now use CamelCase constructors.
	
2004-03-20  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* Moving constructors names to CamelCase. IRTG is my first
	victim. XmlTools is probably broken now.

	* AsFix to IRTG: remove the application of the <START> injection.

	* Setup of testsuite for AsFix to IRTG
	
2004-02-18  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf2rtg: added labelled literal as a symbol
	that is to be ignored.

	* trans/sig/core-rtg2sig: added error reporting for productions
	that cannot be rewritten to a constructor.

	* trans/sig/core-rtg2sig: added 'complex' injections. For example
	List(Foo) -> Definition.

	* trans/asfix/asfix2irtg: started implementation of AsFix2 and
	AsFix2ME to irtg.

2004-02-16  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/sdf2rtg/*: rewritten to produce rtg.

	* trans/sig/core-rtg2sig.str: rewritten to accept rtg.

	* xtc/Makefile.regular: changed Makerules to process rtg instead
	of rhg.
	
2004-02-16  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/rtg-group.str: group rtg productions for the same
	non-terminal.

2004-02-16  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/rtg-reduce.str: removes not productive and not reachable
	non-terminals from an rtg.

2004-02-04  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* xtc/auto-docbook.str: install docbook.m4 and Makefile.docbook

	* xtc/auto-regular.str: install Makefile.regular

2004-01-01  Martin Bravenboer <martin@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/irhg2irtg.str: some dirty hacks to force 'list' to be
	recognized as constructor name.

	RTG has a constructor called 'list' (I know this is stupid). This
	used to work fine, but for some reason in Stratego/XT 0.9.4 this
	constructor names leads to non-terminating programs when used as a
	congruence. Probably something has changed in the way constructors
	are detected, but I'm not sure about that.

	Of course I must rename this constructor ASAP.

2003-08-28  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/rtg-reduce: optimized reachable-nonterms. Using transitive
	closure for this is horrible. rtg of java caused segmentation
	faults.

2003-08-27  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

	* trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str:

    Applying sdf2rtg to the Java grammar of java-front showed 
    some problems. Some of these have been fixed:

    - reject productions should be ignored

    - bracket productions are more flexible regarding
      generating injection productions.

    - empty productions with just a list of literals on the lhs

    Some are however more problematic:

    - injection of a 'not plain symbol' is not easily expressible
      in rtg. For now this is just not allowed.

      Example: {Expr ","}+ -> ForInit

2003-08-25  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * lib/Makefile.am: install logging lib (used by xm-tools).

  * sig/Makefile.am: install rtg-util lib (used by xm-tools).

  * sig/regexp-match.str: rather ad-hoc (desugaring to seq/2) 
    implementation of seq/1 and temp (incrrect) implementation 
    of group/1.

2003-08-24  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sig/core-rtg2sig.str: reimplemented rtg2sig
    using normalized rtg and stratego sorts.

2003-08-21  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/*.str: implementation
    of aliases and renaming strategies. sdf2rtg now
    normalizes aliases before creating a signature.

2003-08-21  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/sdf2-normalization.str:
    Fixing the order of applying normalizations to the
    one specified in Eelco's thesis. Added --keep
    functionality in ast and cs (comparible to strc)
    for debugging.

2003-08-20  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * lib/logging.str: I need my logging lib!

  * trans/sdf-normalization/sdf2-normalization.str: now
    I finally get the way sdf2 should be normalized according
    to Eelco's thesis, I'm rewriting the existing 
    normalization strategies to this style.

2003-08-19  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sig/core-rtg2typematch.str: reimplemented the
    generation of typematching strategies. This time
    using rtg input of course ;) .

  * xtc/rtg2typematch.str: xtc composition applying
    core-rtg2typematch and pp-stratego --abstract.
    sig2rtg | rtg2typematch replaces sig2typematch of 
    stratego-tools.

2003-08-19  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/rtg-desugar.str: renamed to rtg-group. Now
    there are separate rtg-reduce and rtg-normalize tools,
    the meaning of 'desugar' is unclear. rtg-desugar (well,
    rtg-group) just groups the productions of a non-terminal.
    Maybe rtg-desugar should a composition of rtg-reduce,
    rtg-normalize, and rtg-group.

2003-08-18  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sig2rtg/core-sig2rtg.str: implemented
    sig2rtg without using the sig2 tools of
    stratego-tools.

  * xtc/sig2rtg.str: rewritten xtc composition
    to core-sig2rtg.

  * xtc/regular-xtc-tools.str: xtc-str2astratego,
    used strc --ast, not sc --ast.

2003-08-18  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/rtg-normalize.str: applies regexp-normalize.

  * trans/wf-checker/wf-check.str: implemented supported
    for normalized rtg.

2003-08-18  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * syn/regexp.sdf, pp/regexp.pp: removed "," in seq.

  * syn/regexp.sdf: renamed group constructor to
    egroup (explicit group).

  * syn/regexp.sdf: added internal group syntax.

2003-08-16  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * docbook.m4: Autoconf and Automake support for docbook.

  * Makefile.docbook: Make support for docbook

  * doc/sdf2rtg.xml: refentry for sdf2rtg.

2003-08-16  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * Renamed regtg to rtg.

2003-08-15  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * syn/regexp.sdf: switched priorities of , and #.

  * tests/wf/TupleStuff.rtg: using explicit grouping syntax.
    Tests still fail because tools don't support grouping.

2003-08-15  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/rtg-reduce.str: reducing rtgs implemented.

2003-08-15  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/rtg-parsefix.str: typical quote and
    escape realted 'desugarings' are now in rtg-parsefix.

  * trans/rtg-reduce.str: working on tool for reducing rtgs

  * tests/rtg-reduce-test.str: testing reducing strategies:
    are non-terminals productive and reachable?

2003-08-14  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * syn/regexp.sdf: introduced an explicit grouping (tuple)
    operator: regexp # . Tools don't support this yet.

  * pp/rtg-ppfix.str: preprocess AST before pretty printing.
    Adds bracket constructors using the parenthesize module.

  * xtc/regular-xtc-tools.str: apply rtg-ppfix.

2003-08-14  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * pp/regtg.pp: string should be pretty printed as <string>.
  * pp/regtg.pp: int should be pretty printed as <int>.

  * pp/regtg.pp: print parentheses in regexp. todo: implement
    a parenthesize strategy.

  * trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: use sdf sorts to 
    produce start symbols.

  * trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: don't produce
    sequences for iterations with separators that produce
    the empty regexp.

  * trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: some not vary
    attractive fixes to remove empty regexps that are
    considered to be 'relevant' later. This all has to do
    with the decision to let seq regexps represent tuples
    in certain locations. Maybe there should be a more explicit
    tuple construct.

2003-08-14  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/*.str: shut up if verbosity is zero.

  * trans/2rtg/Makefile.am: disabled all sig related tools for now.

  * xtc/Makefile.am: disabled all sig related tools for now.

  * trans/sdf2rtg/core-sdf-grammar2rtg.str: fixed empty sdf 
    productions (like -> TypeAn {cons("NoTp")}).

  * pp/regtg.pp: empty should be pretty printed as / .

2003-08-13  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * trans/2rtg: artg2asig.str: disabled for now
    because of problem with latest StrategoXT
    sources.

  * trans/sdf-normalization/asdf-normalize: renamed
    to core-sdf-normalize.

2003-07-18  Martin Bravenboer <mbravenb@cs.uu.nl>

  * xtc/rtg2sig.str: apply rtg-desugar after parsing

2003-06-24  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/rtg-desugar.str: unquote and unescape
    quoted (non)terminals.

  * syn/regtg.sdf: Added quoted terminals and
    nonterminals (using square brackets).

  * tests/syn/nonterms.testsuite: test syntax for quoted 
    nonterminals.

  * tests/syn/*.rtg: changed to new primitive syntax

  * syn/regtg.sdf: changed the primitive nonterminals
    String and Int to <string> and <int>. This syntax is
    not a valid user defined nonterminal.

2003-06-12  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * syn/regexp.sdf: The empty regular expression
    is now / (was E).

2003-06-12  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * syn/regexp.sdf: changed associativity of seq from
    left to right.
  
  * tests/wf/wf-checker-test.str: started testing tuple
    related stuff.

2003-06-12  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Implemented wf-checker: checks whether an ATerm
    is an instance of a regular tree grammar.

2003-06-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/modular-sdf-normalization:
    - normalize imports and include them as grammars
      (first implementation)
    - fixed bug in merge-grammars. Included better
      error-reporting. No tolerant rewriting.

2003-06-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/modular-sdf-normalization:
    - normalize import sections at start of module to
      exports sections.

2003-06-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf-normalization/asdf-normalize:
    - now returns a grammar (first implementation)

  * trans/sdf2rtg/asdf-grammar-to-artg:
    - now wants a grammar, not a definition

2003-06-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf-normalization:
    - separate directory for sdf normalization
    - split asdf-normalize module into several modules
    - asdf-normalize should become some kind of driver

2003-06-08  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * xtc/sdf2-normalize.str:
    - pass verbose to tools
    - command line --main argument: normalization needs
      a main module.

  * trans/sdf2rtg/asdf-normalize.str:
    - command line --main argument: normalization needs
      a main module.
      
2003-06-08  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf2rtg/asdf-to-artg.str:
    - rewrite syntax sections, not context-free syntax
    - rewrite injections
    - ignore lexical and layout productions
    - fail on productions and sections we cannot rewrite
  * trans/sdf2rtg/asdf-normalize.str:
    - produce layout productions with attributes
  * pp/regtg.pp:
    - pretty print injections (ref)
  * xtc/sdf2rtg.str:
    - pass verbose to tools
    

2003-05-27  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/sdf2rtg/asdf-normalize.str:
    - rewritten many SDF abstract syntax to concrete 
      object syntax.
    - renamed some strategies to make the connection
      to definitions in Eelco's thesis clear. Some
      of these strategies might become a sdf-lib in the
      future?
    - started implementation of ordering and merging of
      grammars and sections.

2003-05-26  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Started using concrete syntax for SDF2 and rtg in
    unit-testing sdf2rtg.

  * Started implementation of SDF2 normalizations. This
    is temporary tool in this package: when it has matured
    it will move to sdf-tools. Normalization of lexical
    and context free syntax sections is required for an
    acceptable sdf2rtg.

2003-04-17  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * sig/regexp-match.str: implemented regexp-match
    for plus

  * trans/implode/implode-irtg.str: implemented implosion
    of iplus (to list) and iseq (to tuple)

  * tests/match/char-match-test.str: added some more
    interesting tests.

2003-04-17  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * trans/implode.str: implemented implosion of
    labellel content.

  * sig/iregtg.str: added constructs for instances
    of labelled content.

2003-04-10  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added non-terminal references as right hand sides.
    In rtg-desugar they will be replaced by the 
    productions of the non-terminal. Cycles are not
    allowed.

  * Introduced rtg-desugar

2003-04-09  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Added choice syntax for multiple right hand sides
    in a production. This is not sugar: more production
    rules for the same non-terminal will be desugared to
    one production rule with multiple rhss

2003-04-07  Martin Bravenboer <martin@mbravenboer.org>

  * Creation of package, sources taken from xml-tools
