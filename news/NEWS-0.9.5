StrategoXT 0.9.5 -- released March 26, 2004

---------++ Summary of Changes

   * JIRA Issue Tracking System
   * Improved documentation of tools
   * Many bug fixes
   * New hashtable strategies
   * Concise syntax for ParseUnit test-suites
   * Upgrade of the SDF language

---------++ Configuration

*Important:* StrategoXT 0.9.5 requires more recent versions of the SDF
implementation in PGEN (2.0) and SGLR. The sdf2-bundle 2.0.1 provides
all required SDF packages and is available from the release page of
StrategoXT 0.9.5.

Packages that require StrategoXT usually apply the USE_XT_PACKAGES
macro of =autoxt= to add =--with-x= configuration flags to the
configure script. This macro now also provides a =--with-strategoxt=
argument, which is an alternative to the =--with-stratego-xt=
flag. The additional flag corresponds to the package name of
StrategoXT, which is =strategoxt=.

---------++ JIRA Issue Tracking System

We have finally adopted an issue tracking system for StrategoXT and
related projects. Arthur van Dam suggested to use JIRA, which is free
(not Free) for open-source projects. Fortunately he has taken care of
evaluating and installing it as well. We have just started to use the
system, but it looks very promising. The user-interface is very
attractive compared to Bugzilla and JIRA provides many useful
overviews for developers, without having to struggle with a generic
query interface.

Our JIRA installation is public and everyone can submit issues. Please
report issues directly to the JIRA issue tracking system from now
on. New issues reported in JIRA will be send to the stratego-bugs
mailing list for notification. However, the issue in JIRA is the
preferred place to for comments. Of course you are welcome to discuss
issues at the stratego-dev mailing list first.

---------++ Documentation

Documentation for users of StrategoXT has improved in several areas.

Rob Vermaas, who is now a scientific programmer at our institute, is
working on updating the completely out-of-date README files in the
distribution. Many sub-packages have already been updated, but some
work remains to be done at this point.

(Rob Vermaas)

Feedback by new users inspired us to revive the Tools web and start
working on a comprehensive reference for the tools in StrategoXT. The
reference is still far from complete, but it is a start. Tool
documentation in the tool reference should provide an introduction,
explanation of the command-line arguments and usage examples, The tool
reference is a Wiki, so you are all welcome to improve and extend the
available documentation. The tools of GPP are already documented
pretty thorough.

We have started to develop a central website for all information
related to SDF at the program-transformation Wiki. In this case as
well we were inspired by new users having problems to find
documentation and pointers to relevant information. The new website is
available at

   * http://www.syntax-definition.org

---------++ Compiler

The name of a module declared in file did not really matter in the
past. This was rather frustrating in the development of xDoc. From
StrategoXT 0.9.5 the compiler outputs a warning message if the
declared module name does not correspond with the name of the file.

StrategoXT 0.9.5 fixes several bugs and shortcomings in the
user-interface of the Stratego compiler and tools of stratego-front
such as =parse-stratego= and =pp-stratego=. From this release
=pp-stratego= for example accepts an =-I= flag, which can be used to
provide a search path for parse tables used for concrete object
syntax.

(Rob Vermaas)

In StrategoXT 0.9.4 compiling programs that use term arguments
resulted in loads of warnings from the C compiler. These warnings are
caused by the type declarations of the term argument, which are not
declared correctly in the C code produced by the Stratego
compiler. This problem has been fixed in this release. The declared
types of the argument are now correct for term arguments.

(Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Stratego Standard Library

The Stratego Standard Library (SSL) in 0.9.5 features a new hashtable
implementation. Hashtables used to be handled by name in the Stratego
runtime, SSL, and custom Stratego code. It is now possible to pass
hashtables around directly, not by a name. This feature is comparable
to the Stratego =Stream= representation of native streams. Hashtables
that are created in this way will not affect other parts of the
program, unless the hashtable is passed to the code. The old table
mechanism is of course still available and is still useful to
implicitly pass information around. The new hashtable strategies
include: =new-hashtable(|initial_size, max_load)=,
=hashtable-put(|key, value)=, =hashtable-get(|key)=. We are
considering to lift hashtables from the API to the language level by
providing syntax for constructing and accessing hashtables. The old
hashtable strategies (=table-get=, =table-put= etc.) will be expressed
in terms of the new strategies in the next release.

(Martin Bravenboer)

A common mistake in the SUnit unit-testing framework is forgetting a
=!= before an input or output term. SUnit now provides a variant of
the unit-testing strategies that accept term arguments for the
description, input, and expected output of a test e.g.
=apply-test(foo | "foo test", input, output)=

(Rob Vermaas)

The SSL module =term-io= in the SSL features new strategies for writing
ATerms to strings (=write-to-string=) and vice versa
(=read-from-string=). These strategies have been added to accept ATerm
values as command-line arguments, but they should be useful in
general.

(Martin Bravenboer)

The SSL module list-set provides a general subset checker (=set-eq=,
=subset=, =subseteq=). All these strategies are parameterizable with a
user-defined compare/eq strategy.

(Arthur van Dam)

---------++ Utilities

---------+++ Pretty-Printing

The pp-table-diff utility from now on fails if the output should not
be used as a patch (=--patch=), but the existing pp-table is not
complete. This is useful for signaling incompleteness of the
pretty-print table during a build, especially in the buildfarm.

More information:
  http://www.program-transformation.org/Tools/PrettyPrintTableDiff

The pretty-print table generator =ppgen= has been extended to handle a
wider range of SDF constructs.

(Merijn de Jonge)

---------+++ Syntax Definition and Parsing

SDF related tools in StrategoXT 0.9.4 are using a rather old version
of SDF, namely 2.1. There are not a lot of differences between this
SDF version and the most recent one used in PGEN 2.0, but since SDF
will undergo more heavy changes in the near future, it is important to
be up-to-date. We are working on updating our SDF tools to support the
most recent version of SDF as found in PGEN 2.0. As a first step in
this direction the sdf-front package now includes both versions of
SDF. In the next release we will no longer distribute an SDF syntax
definition, but directly work on the definition provided in the SDF
distribution.

Unfortunately some tools are still using the new syntax
definition. For example =pack-sdf= uses the new one, but =sdf-to-sig=
still uses the old one. This situation will be solved in the next
release, where SDF 2.1 will not be used anymore, except for its
syntax, signatures and pretty-printer.

---------+++ Parse-Unit

ParseUnit, a tool for unit-testing syntax definitions, has been
extended with a concise, concrete syntax for testsuites. The new
testsuite syntax also allows partial specification of expected
outcomes by using wildcards. The concrete syntax for ParseUnit
testsuites does not require escaping of special characters in the
test input. This makes the inputs much more readable, because special
characters are in practice not special in parse testsuites.

(Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ SDF Renamed Module Generator

Syntax definitions of concrete object syntax embeddings require
renamings of the sorts of the imported syntax definitions. Defining
these renaming modules by hand is annoying and error-prone. The
sdf-tools package of StrategoXT now features =gen-renamed-sdf-module=
a tool that automates this task. It takes an SDF syntax definition and
produces an SDF module that renames the sorts in some user-definable
way, by prefixing it with the language name for example.
