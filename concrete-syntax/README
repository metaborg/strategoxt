Package: CONCRETE-SYNTAX

PARSE-CS
----------------------------

Usage: parse-cs -i file.ext -o file.ast [-I incldir ...] [Options]

Uses: file.meta and/or ext.meta

For other options see parse-cs -h

Parse-cs is a generic tool for parsing programs with embedded concrete
syntax. The program is parameterized with meta-data indicating
components for various aspects such as parsing, exploding, desugaring,
and pretty-printing. The meta data can be specified in a .meta file
specific for a program to be parsed, or it can be associated with an
extension and registered in an XTC repository.

For example, the following is the contents of pl.meta, the meta-data
for Prolog programs with embedded syntax. The assumption (in this
example) is that syntax embeddings use a standard (ToTerm) convention
for indicating the boundary between meta- and object-syntax.

	  Meta([
	    Syntax("Prolog"),
	    ParseTable("Prolog.tbl"),
	    Explode("prolog-explode"),
	    PrettyPrintTable("Prolog-pretty.pp.af")
	  ])

This information can be overridden in a file specific .meta file with
the same extension. For example, the following indicates an embedding
of ABIR in Prolog and a specific desugaring tool for this format:

	  Meta([
	    Syntax("PrologABIR"),
	    PostExplodeDesugar("abir-in-prolog-implode")
	  ])

It overrides the syntax component, and adds a desugaring component.

In order to define such meta-data for a whole class of programs, it
can be defined in a meta file associated with a new extension. For
example, the following is the contents plabir.meta, which defines all
meta-data for preprocessing Prolog with embedded ABIR in files with
extension .plabir.
	
	  Meta([
	    Syntax("PrologABIR"),
	    Explode("prolog-explode"),
	    PostExplodeDesugar("abir-in-prolog-implode"),
	    PrettyPrintTable("Prolog-pretty.pp.af")
	  ])

Concrete Syntax Tools
----------------------------

Parse-cs is the only tool provided by the package at the moment. Other
tools that might be provided in the future include:

- embed-syntax : combines two syntax definitions embedding one
  in the other by generating quotation productions and variable
  schemas according to a standard schema which might be adapted.

- gen-explode : a generic explosion transformation for embeddings that
  can be expressed locally (term-like API in host language) and
  generically
