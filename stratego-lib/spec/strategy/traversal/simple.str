/**
 * This module contains generic one-pass traversals over terms.
 *
 * These traversals have been defined using the primitive term traversal

 *
 * Term traversals can be categorized into classes according to
 * how much of the term they traverse and to which parts
 * of the term they modify. Please read the annotated source code
 * to see the breakdown.
