The *maak* script appear to compile the dynamic rule tests. Question is whether this script is needed? Perhaps this step can be included as part of the build process!

Ok, it's clear that maak is a nested compilation process for these tests. Every folder inside *til/* contains a maak script. Leaving here until we can figure out whether we can run the tests from Ant.
