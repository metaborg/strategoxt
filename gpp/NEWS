Version 0.9 (versioning scheme of StrategoXT)
  * GPP is now called box-tools and is part of StrategoXT.
  * All tools are implemented in Stratego, shell-scripts
    are replaced by XTC tools.
  * important changes that might cause problems with 
    existing software:
      - verbose options are now all the standard Stratego
        options: --verbose int and -S. The -v argument has
        another meaning: the version of the tool will
        be shown.
      - Makefile to pretty print terms or parse pretty print
        tables is gone. You should use the new tools.
      - tohtml is not yet available as part of box-tools
  * gen-css-boxstyle: generate css for abox2html. 
    Uses standard -o argument to specify target. 
    abox2html -c just forwards to gen-css-boxstyle and
    also listens to the -o argument.
  * abox2text listens to width argument
  * abox2text supports HV boxes
  * abox2text now supports the HV and A/R boxes. The current
    implementation does not support R cells that will occupy 
    more than one line and must be aligned center or right.
    Left alignment should work. Single line cells works for
    all alginments.
  * new tools: pp-box, parse-box, parse-pp-table, pp-pp-table.
  * ast2abox accepts .pp.af pretty print tables as arguments.
    If you pass a .pp argument the tool will look for an
    existing .af version of this table and use this one if the
    .pp version is not newer. In all other cases the .pp table
    will be parsed to _temporary_ file.
  * grammars and pretty print tables of box and pp-tables are 
    separated.
  * abox-format doesn't complain about AOPTIONS.

Version 2.3 released: 2002-08-02
  * asfix2abox now produces an error message when it encounters an
	  ambiguity.
	* handling lists of the form "literal"* has been fixed.
	* abox2text fixes a bug when a V box contains empty sub boxes.

Version 2.2 released: 2002-06-14
	* fixed handling of abbreviation tables passed to abox2latex
	* fixed pretty-printing of integers in ast2abox
	* GPP now compiles and runs on Windows using Cygwin
	* Added support for layout preserving pretty-printing. Use
          asfix2abox with -c switch
	* Several bug fixes
   	* ast2abox: integegers are now correctly pretty-printed (i.e.,
	   echo 1 | ast2abox yields S("1") )

Version 2.1 released: 2001-11-29
	* Fixed error in default.abbrevs.
	* Added support for generatin bootstrapped-distributions of gpp.
	* Pretty-print tables ow accept quoted strings as constructor names.

Version 2.0 released: 2001-09-20
	* This package replaces the gpp package version 1.33 and earlier.
	  The implementation is now Stratego-based instead of ASF-based.
	  This implementation of the gpp tools was extracted from the
	  Grammar Tools package version 0.7.
	* Functionality for generating latex and html files has been
          re-added.
