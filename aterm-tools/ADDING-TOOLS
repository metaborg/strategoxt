To add a component "foo" to the package

* Create a subdirectory in the src directory

	mkdir src/foo

  and a sub-directory for test data 

        mkdir src/foo/data

* Add "foo" to the list of unreleased components in package.conf

* Create src/foo/Makefile.am and src/foo/data/Makefile.

* Do reconf -d to generate the corresponding Makefile.in files.

* To generate the corresponding Makefiles, do

	./config.status --recheck
	./config.status

* Now you can start adding files to src/foo and src/foo/data.
