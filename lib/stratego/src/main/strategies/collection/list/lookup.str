/**
 * This module contains strategies for working on associative lists.
 * 
 * Associative lists are on the form [(key1, value1), (key2, value2), ...]
 * Each key must be unique for the strategies in this module to operate
 * correctly. Any term can be used as key. 
 *
 * The associative lists must be created correctly by the application code;
 * this module only contains strategies for searching associative lists.
 *
 * Keys may have annotations. These are considered to be part of the key,
 * so identical term with differing annotations are effectively different
 * keys.
