     for checking the structure of an aterm,

   * New features and various usability enhancements in parse-unit, a

Deployment

   * Improved Autoconf macros in AutoXT

---------++ Format Checking

The format-check tool has been reimplemented in order to boost
performance, and improve error-reporting and visualization. The format
checker now uses a bottom-up algorithm for format checking. The tool
infers types in a bottom-up fashion and will complain at the innermost
term for which no type can be inferred. If this term has subterms,
then their inferred types will be shown. The performance is even
better in =--fast= mode, but this might reduce the quality of the
error reports.

Format-check now supports a =--vis= mode for showing format errors in
a pretty-printed aterm at the command-line. Format-errors will be
indicated in red if the terminal supports colors.

Format-check also has a new feature to report the results of type
inference in an HTML document. This document contains the input term,
formatted in the same way as pp-aterm. All innermost format errors in
the aterm are indicated by red boxes. Moving over the aterm with your
mouse will show the inferred types of the aterms in an information
box.

---------++ Pack SDF

Several features have been added to pack-sdf to make it more
user-friendly:

   * pack-sdf now checks if the module name specified in an SDF module
     file, corresponds to the actual filename. Having different names
     can lead to very nasty problems.

   * The order of include path entries has been improved to make it
     more clear. The directory of the main module (specified with -i)
     is now the first include option. This is not always the current
     directory, in which case unexpected modules might be imported in
     previous versions of <nop>StrategoXT. So, pack-sdf -i syn/Foo.sdf will
     search for module in the syn directory.

   * The input file is no longer searched for in the include
     path. That is, pack-sdf -i Foo.sdf now always packs ./Foo.sdf,
     not a module Foo elsewhere in the include path if ./Foo.sdf does
     not exist.

   * A warning is printed if a specified include directory does not
     exist.

   * Improved error reporting for missing modules. Usually, the module
     is not really missing, but the name of this import is
     incorrect. Hence, it is useful to report the module(s) from where
     the 'missing' module is imported. Pack SDF now prints a detailed
     report of all missing modules and the module where these are
     imported.

   * pack-sdf now reports all missing modules in a single execution.

   * pack-sdf now (again) supports the creation of a dependency file
     suitable for inclusion in a Makefile. Makefile.xt will instruct
     pack-sdf to do this, so there is no longer a need to specify
     dependencies of SDF files.

---------++ Parse Unit

In previous releases of <nop>StrategoXT, parse-unit testsuites had to be
parsed with a separate tool before passing it to parse-unit. This is
obviously a bad idea, so parse-unit itself now parses the
testsuite. It will fall back to abstract syntax, so this change should
not break existing makefiles. The =--abstract-input= option can be
used to declare that you are passing a testsuite in abstract syntax.

Parse-unit now has an option to parse a single test and write the
result to the output. In this mode ambiguities are accepted, which is
useful for debugging. The option for this 'single test mode' is
=--single <nr>= where =<nr>= is the number in the testsuite (printed
when the testsuite is executed). The =--asfix2= flag can be used to
produce asfix2 instead of an AST.

Parse-unit now accepts a =--no-heuristic-filters= flag to disable the
heuristic -fi (injection count) and -fe (eagerness) disambiguation
filters of sglr. Using this flag is highly encouraged.

---------++ Parenthesizer Generation

A major bug in in the generation of rewrite rules for chain priorities
has been fixed in this release of <nop>StrategoXT. In the previous version,
the tool assumed that the SDF normalizer generates chain priorities
for the transitive closure of the priorities that are defined in an
SDF syntax definition. However, this is not the case and therefore the
parenthesize generator now applies the transitive closure itself.

Also, the determination of conflicting patterns in an AST has been
separated from the parenthesize generator in the tool
=sdf2ast-conflicts=. This tool might be useful for other applications.

---------++ Pragmatic XML Support

In <nop>StrategoXT 0.12 some new tools are available that makes
interoperability with other programs and libraries that are based on
XML seamless. The tools aterm2xml and xml2aterm support this
conversion from aterm to XML and vice versa. Since applications have
different needs, there are three conversion modes available: implicit,
explicit, and very explicit. The default mode, explicit, support a
round trip for most common aterms.

---------++ Support for Comment Preserving Transformations

asfix-anno-comments is a new asfix to asfix tool that preserves
comments that were of the input source code by putting them in
annotations of the AST.

Implode-asfix now supports preservation of annotations in AsFix
trees. This means that implode-asfix now supports the addPosInfo
position annotation tool, and the just mentioned comment annotation
tool.

---------++ Language Enhancements

In <nop>StrategoXT 0.10 the =bagof-R= strategy was introduced. This
strategy returns all applications of a dynamic rule. However,
=bagof-R= only applies the dynamic rules that been defined in the
innermost (most recent) scope where a rule =R= was defined. So, if
dynamic rules with name =A= have been defined in several scopes, then
not all applications are returned, but only the ones of defined in the
innermost scope.

In this release there is bigger bagof: =all-R=. This strategy applies
all the defined dynamic rules of name =R=.

In <nop>StrategoXT 0.10 we added the if-then-else construct, which is
basically just an alternative syntax for the guarded left choice
(=where(s1) < s2 + s3=). Since we found ourselves writing a lot =if s1
then s2 else id end=, we have now also added an if-then
construct. This new strategy =if s1 then s2 end= is equivalent to =if
s1 then s2 else id end=.

---------++ Improved New Name

The library strategy =newname= (which is used for generating unique
identifiers) now trims any trailing digits up to the rightmost
'_'. Hence, repeated application of =newname= will no longer result in
mutiple numeric postfixes (for example =a_0_0=).

For example:
<verbatim>
    <newname> "a"        // produces "a_0"
  ; <newname> "b"        // produces "b_0"
  ; <newname> "b_1"      // produces "b_2"
  ; <newname> "b_1729"   // produces "b_3"
  ; <newname> "b_a"      // produces "b_a_0"
</verbatim>

----------++ AutoXT 

The Autconf support of AutoXT has been updated. Autoconf macros of
=autoxt.m4= now perform more checks. For example, Autoconf now fails
if there are undefined macros with the XT prefix. Furthermore,
=autoxt.m4= now defines a macro =XT_ARG_WITH= for concisely adding
=--with-PACKAGE= arguments to configure scripts in your own packages.

If you are developing packages based on <nop>StrategoXT and AutoXT, then
you must have Autoconf 2.58 or newer. This does not affect users: the
installation of a <nop>StrategoXT distribution doesn't require Autoconf.
