---------++ Separate Compilation

The basic implementation of separate compilation of Stratego programs
has been available from [[StrategoRelease094][StrategoXT 0.9.4]], but
the feature has always been experimental. However, it was already
clear that separate compilation drastically reduces the compilation
time of Stratego programs. The open issues in the implementation of
separate compilation, which are mostly configuration related, have all
been resolved in this release, StrategoXT 0.11. Therefore, separate
compilation of Stratego is now ready for use.

First, AutoXT has been extended with support for separate
compilation. Because of the support in AutoXT, using separate
compilation in your packages is very easy. Second, separate
compilation is now also supported for XTC tools, for which separate
compilation is very useful. Third, the stand-alone Stratego compiler
=strc= now accepts flags for separate compilation. This is very
convenient for small tests programs, or just for testing separate
compilation.

The exact details of using separate compilation are explained in a
[[HowToUseSeparateCompilation][how to]] available at the Stratego
website (documentation section).

---------++ Shared libraries in the Stratego runtime

In StrategoXT 0.11 the Stratego Runtime System (srts) uses Libtool to
build libraries. This means that shared libraries are created if the
platform supports this. Since linkers by default prefer shared
libraries over static libraries, your programs will be linked against
the shared libraries of the Stratego runtime. This reduces the size of
the executable and the code of the library will be shared by all
Stratego programs.

Using shared libraries introduces the usual problems of locating these
libraries when a program is executed. This might cause problems for
users of your packages: if you do not change the way your programs are
linked, then at most systems the shared libraries will not be found if
the package is installed at a non-standard location. To solve this
issue, we advice to use Libtool for linking, since Libtool adds the
path of a dynamic library to the search path of an executable. For an
overview of all options to avoid or prefer shared libraries, see the
[[HowToUseSharedLibraries][how to use shared libraries]] at the
Stratego website.

---------++ Cygwin and Mac OS X Support

For StrategoXT 0.10 we announced support for Mac OS X. Unfortunately,
this claim soon appeared to be poorly verified: we received several
reports of failures at Mac OS X. For StrategoXT 0.11, we have worked
on solving all these issues and can now safely re-announce support for
Mac OS X. StrategoXT 0.11 has been compiled and checked at two
different Mac OS X 10.3.4 systems with Apple's GCC 3.3
(unpatched). Older versions of GCC will probably not work. From now
on, binary distributions for Mac OS X will be available at the release
page.

Various problems had to be fixed in order to support Mac OS X:

   * A very creepy issue with optimizations performed by GCC has been
   worked-around in the implementation of the =some= traversal
   primitive.

   * Various issues with separate compilation at Mac OS X have been
   fixed. For example, initializers of dynamic libraries are by
   default invoked in a lazy way at Mac OS X. This issue has been
   fixed in AutoXT by passing a flag to the linker at Darwin systems.

   * The stand-alone Stratego compiler now passes more standard flags
   to GCC.

   (Eelco Dolstra, Martin Bravenboer and Dick Eimers)

Cygwin support has also been verified. Unfortunately, separate
compilation is currently not supported at Cygwin, due to limitations
of Microsoft Windows DLLs. As a result, static linking is used for the
separately compiled SSL and executables are rather large. We hope to
fix this in a future release. From StrategoXT 0.11 binary
distributions for Cygwin will be available at the release pages.

   (Eelco Dolstra and Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Various Deployment Improvements

Besides the support for Mac OS X and Cygwin, the deployment of
StrategoXT has been improved at several other points. First, the
distributions of StrategoXT 0.11 are much smaller then the
distributions of the last few releases. A source distribution is now
about 9 MB, which used to be 14 MB. This has been achieved by (1) not
distributing bootstrapped sources of programs that are only used in a
check, (2) not distributing parse tables, (3) reduction of the size of
bootstrapped sources by heavy use of separate compilation in
StrategoXT, (4) removing some tools that are obsolete or not working
properly.

Second, the dependencies of StrategoXT are now finally checked in the
configure script. If the provided configuration is incorrect, then the
configure will fail and explain where the tools were expected in the
configuration provided (or not) by the user. The configure scripts
checks for the ATerm-gcc library in the aterm package, which reflects
the requirement to configure this package with the --with-gcc
flag. The StrategoXT configure script now also checks for several
tools that are part of the packages of the sdf2-bundle.

The checks have been implemented as macros (=XT_PKG_ATERM= and
=XT_PKG_SDF=) in AutoXT, so you can use them in your package as
well. The macro =XT_PKG_STRATEGOXT= can be used if you want to check
that the provided configuration for StrategoXT is correct. This macro
checks that some essential tools in StrategoXT are available at the
specified prefix. If you want to, then you can also invoke the checks
for the specific program directly: they are available as XT_PROG_
macros in AutoXT.

   (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Upgrade of SDF Packages

StrategoXT 0.11 uses a new version of the SDF language and its
implementation. The SDF packages are collected in the sdf2-bundle 2.2,
which is available at the release page of StrategoXT 0.11.

%RED%Important: %ENDCOLODR% the new version of SDF contains a new
construct for declaring start symbols of the syntax definition. In
older versions of SDF there was no way to declare start
symbols. Instead, all declared sorts were implicitly added as start
symbols. You must add this new explicit declaration of start-symbols
to your syntax definition, otherwise the generated parse table will
not parse anything. For example, if you want =Module= to be a start
symbol of your syntax definition, then you should add a declaration
=context-free start-symbols Module= to you syntax definition. You can
also declare more complex start symbols, for example lists. Declaring
all sorts (in a =sorts= construct)is now encouraged, since the parse
table generator is then able to do more static checking of the syntax
definition and warn you about suspicious constructs.

   (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Support for XML Processing

StrategoXT 0.11 has a new sub-package: =xml-front-. This package
contains an SDF syntax definition for XML, a pretty-printer for XML,
an embedding of XML in Stratego, and various tools for XML
processing. The syntax definition of XML and the accompanying tools can
be used for the implementation of XML transformations, for generating
XML (e.g. XHTML web pages) or for interoperability with external
XML-based tools. How you can use the tools of =xml-front= for XML
applications will be explained in some HowTo's at the Stratego
Wiki. The first one will explain the embedding of XML in Stratego,
which is in particular useful for generating XML in Stratego programs.

   (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ New and Improved Tools

Many tools in StrategoXT have been improved. Some highlights:

_pack-sdf_ now supports the "-Idef Foo.def" flag. This flag can
be used to import SDF modules (.sdf) from an SDF syntax definition
(.def). The order of mixed -I and -Idef arguments is respected.

_sdf2parenthesize_ is a new tool that generates a Stratego
transformation tool that adds the necessary parentheses to an abstract
syntax tree. The information is obtained from an SDF syntax
definition. The tool handles associativity, relative priorities, and
groups of associative productions. The tool has successfully been
applied to improve the pretty-printers of Stratego in stratego-front
and Java in JavaFront. The tool is explained in more detail at the
Tools web: 

   * http://www.program-transformation.org/Tools/SdfToParenthesize

_sdf2rtg_, which is used for the generation of Stratego
signatures, now uses the real start symbols of the SDF syntax
definition and not the declared sorts. sdf2rtg also complains if the
syntax definition contains no start symbols at all.

---------++ New strategies in the Stratego library

The Stratego Standard Library has been extended with several useful
strategies. 

The =newname= strategy is a variant of the =new= strategy. It
generates unique strings, just like new, but it also accepts an prefix
that will be part of the generated string. By default, the numbering
is also done per prefix. For example, if you apply newname three times
to the string "foo", then the results will be ="foo_0"=, ="foo_1"= and
="foo_2"=. If the newname is applied to "bar" after this, then the
result will be ="bar_0"=, not ="bar_4"=. Thus, The =newname= strategy
is very useful for generating more user-friendly, unique names in a
program transformation.

  (Arthur van Dam)

The new =sets= module provides support for efficient, stateful sets,
comparable to stateful hashtables in the =tables= module. Like
hashtables, the set implementation is based on an implementation of
this data structure in the ATerm library.

  (Martin Bravenboer)

The =posix-file= module has been extended with the directory
primitives =mkdir= and =rmdir=. The strategy =filemode= returns the
mode of a file. The strategy =mkdtemp= can be used to created
temporary directories.

The module =char-io= has been extended with the strategy
=filter-text-file= for filtering characters sequences from text
files. This strategy is especially useful if you need to filter a file
in a way that that depend on multiple lines. =filter-text-file= is
parameterized with two strategies: a strategy for transforming the
current 'chunk' of characters and a strategy to commit the current
chunk.

  (Eelco Visser)

---------++ Various improvements of XTC

In StrategoXT 0.11 AutoXT also constructs build-time XTC
repositories. A build-time repository refers to files in the build
tree, instead of the installation directory. The repository is named
XTC and is created in the top-level directory of the build
tree. Build-time repositories can be used to invoke tools in the build
tree at build- or check-time. Thus, build-time XTC repositories can be
used to implement support for a 'make check' without having the
package installed. Indeed, the StrategoShell and JavaFront have
already been changed to use the build-time repositories and now fully 
support a pre-install check and 'make distcheck'.

From StrategoXT 0.11, XTC tools be compiled with stand-alone Stratego
compiler, =strc=. Until now, XTC tools could only be implemented in
complete packages with an AutoXT based build-system. From this
release, =strc= takes a flag =--xtc-repo= to set the default XTC
repository when invoking strc as a full program compiler. This
argument has no meaning if strc only produces C code. The definition
of a default XTC repository with the =--xtc-repo= flag is also
optional: if you leave it out, the tool will have no default XTC
repository and will therefore use the environment variable
XTC_REPOSITORY or a repository =passed to the tool when it is
invoked. In this way, it is now much easier to implement ad-hoc
Stratego programs that invoke other tools using XTC. It might also be
useful for users that are new to XTC and just want to experiment.

   (Martin Bravenboer)

---------++ Global choice operator

The global choice operator is now much easier to use. The global
choice operator =++= was introduced in Stratego 0.8, but to use it,
StrategoXT had to be configured with the location of the CPL for
StrategoXT. If the CPL was available, then it was used for all
programs compiled with this installation of StrategoXT. By moving the
choice for the implementation of choice-points to link-time, this is
now much more flexible and easy to use: the new version of the CPL for
StrategoXT (will be released in a few days) can be installed _after_
the installation of StrategoXT and for each program you can decide
whether you want to use the implementation of global choices in the
CPL. If a program uses the global choice, but it is not linked with
the CPL, then linking will fail.

If the CPL is installed an registered in the XTC repository of
StrategoXT, then the Stratego compiler takes an argument =--cpl=,
which will link the program with the CPL. The new configuration for
the CPL and the new =strc= option for linking with the CPL, make it
very easy to experiment with the global choice implementation.

---------++ Many bug-fixes

In StrategoXT 0.11 many bugs have been fixed in tools, the library,
and the compiler. Some highlights:

   * fixed a bug in the implementation of =mkstemp= that causes
     segmentation faults in large programs that use this strategy. In
     particular, XTC composition were affected. The segmentation fault
     occurs during garbage collection of ATerms by the ATerm library.

   * Several bugs have been fixed in the new implementation of dynamic
     rules, which was introduced in StrategoXT 0.10. Also, the
     performance of scope labelling has been improved by applying the
     new stateful sets.

   * In the backend of the Stratego compiler a bug has been fixed in
     the generation of code for mutual recursive strategies declared
     locally in a let. The backend of =strc= now declares all local
     functions before defining them.
