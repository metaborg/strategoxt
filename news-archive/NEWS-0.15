StrategoXT 0.15 -- released ...

This is a release of a major milestone in the Stratego Core
refactoring project. It is not considered to be a production release
to be used by average users. Use of the release for testing by
seasoned Stratego developers who maintain applications in the
Stratego/XT environment, would be appreciated, however.

This release will be followed by a number of minor releases,
introducing improvements in the areas of the compiler back-end,
dynamic rules, the module system, and the optimizer. This should
result in a stable and much improved Stratego compiler in release
0.16.

Since the distributions before 0.16 are experimental, distributions
are only provided through the Nix release management system. No
binaries for Windows and MacOSX will be available.

---------++!! Summary of Changes

%TOC%

---------++ Stratego Language

---------+++ Stratego Core Language

The Stratego Core language project constitutes a major refactoring of
the syntax definition of the language, also requiring a refactoring of
all tools and components processing Stratego programs (in particular
the compiler).

The project was prompted by the problems encountered in building the
first version of the Stratego Optimizer in 2003. In particular, with
the representation of term annotations in the abstract syntax. In
addition the language design had eroded somewhat over the years
through the addition of new features.

Thus, the aims of the project are threefold:

(1) Clearly distinguish a core language to be used as intermediate
language in the compiler. 

(2) Explicitly represent term annotations in the abstract syntax of
the core language.

(3) Cleaning up the language, removing constructs that have not proven
to be useful, or have been subsumed by more more general constructs.

---------+++ Impact

Despite the changes in the _structure_ of the language, the syntax is
backwards compatible. This entails that existing applications should
still work. Except of course for applications using constructs that
have been removed. However, the decision to remove constructs was
based on the fact that these were not used (some not even document),
so this shouldn't pose a big problem. The only change with potential
impact is discontinuation of support for old style dynamic rules. New
style dynamic rules are the default in StrategoXT 0.14 and should be a
good platform for preparing migration.

---------+++ Core vs Sugar 

The syntax definition is now divided into a Stratego-Core language
that is extended to the full language in Stratego-Sugar, adding
syntactic abstractions to the Core. The Core is a strict subset of the
full language. In addition, a number of regular tree grammars has been
defined that denote a number of intermediate languages between
Stratego-Sugar and Stratego-Core. These RTGs are used by the compiler
to verify the sanity of the compiler components.

---------+++ Term Annotations

Term annotations were not originally supported in Stratego. The
addition was handled by desugaring the matching and building of terms
with annotions to calls to ATerm library functions using primitives in
an early stage of compilation. The implicit presence of annotations
made transformations within the compiler very fragile, and entailed
that certain optimizations could not be defined properly.

In the new core syntax, terms always have an annotation. A pre-term
(pt) has the form

   pt := i | r | x | c(t1,...,tn)

and denotes a term without annotation. A term (t) is a pre-term with
an annotation (which is itself a pre-term):

   t  := pt{^pt}

This is the explicit representation of term annotations; every term
always has a list of annotations.  That is, the annotation pre-term
should always be a *list* of the form

   Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn, Nil())

Since most terms do not have annotations, or we're not interested
in them, in the sugared extension of the core language, term annotations
are optional. Thus, in Stratego-Sugar, the syntax of terms is extended
with:

   t := pt | pt{t1,...,tn}

The interpretation of this syntax depends on the use of the term in
a match or build position. That is, the following desugaring rules
apply:

   |[ !pt ]| -> |[ !pt{^Nil()} ]|
   |[ !pt{t1,...,tn} ]| -> |[ !pt{^Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn,Nil()))} ]|

   |[ ?pt ]| -> |[ ?pt{^_} ]|
   |[ ?pt{t1,...,tn} ]| -> |[ ?pt{^Cons(t1,...,Cons(tn,Nil()))} ]|

(Note that this is a bit simplified, as the Conses and Nils in the
right-hand side have annotations themselves, except for the outermost
ones.)

So a rewrite rule

  A : Plus(x, y) -> Plus(y, x)

is desugared to

  A : Plus(x, y){^_} -> Plus(y, x){^Nil()}

(STR-58)

---------+++ Disambiguation

The syntax of types of higher-order arguments of strategy definitions
was ambiguous. Thus, the type of the skip argument in

<verbatim>
  topdownS(s : ATerm() -> ATerm() , skip : a -> a * a -> a) = ...
</verbatim>

could be parsed as 

<verbatim>
  a -> (a * a -> a)   or ((a -> a) * a) -> a
</verbatim>

This has been solved by only allowing function types as argument types
when between parentheses. Thus, the above is not syntactically valid,
but should now be written as 

<verbatim>
  topdownS(s : ATerm() -> ATerm() , skip : (a -> a) * a -> a) = ...
</verbatim>

It is better to require explicit disambiguation since it is easy to
have the wrong expectation from implicit disambiguation in this case.

There was no priority definition between guarded left-choice and
non-deterministic choice, such that the expression

<verbatim>
  s1 < s2 + s3 + s4
</verbatim>

could be parsed in two ways, i.e.,

<verbatim>
  s1 < (s2 + s3) + s4   or   s1 < s2 + (s3 + s4) 
</verbatim>

This has been resolved by giving the =+= operator higher priority than
guarded choice to prefer the latter over the former. The first variant
can be selected by using explicit parentheses.

---------+++ Rules in let

Let bindings can now introduce new rules. For example,

<verbatim>
  main =
    let Foo : 1 -> 2
     in <Foo> 1 => 2
    end 
</verbatim>

Local rules shadow rules with the same name (and arity) at
top-level. The scope of the rule variables is the enclosing
definition, not just the rule itself! This is in line with the
semantics of local definitions, but the practicality of this design
choice should be reviewed.

(Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Outdated constructs no longer supported

A number of language constructs have been subsumed by more general
constructs, or were simply never used. These constructs have been
removed from the language definition starting with this release.

_Old style dynamic rules_ are no longer supported. Everything
expressible with old style rules can also be expressed with new style
dynamic rules. See the paper 'Program Transformation with Scoped
Dynamic Rewrite Rules' for definition and examples of new style
dynamic rules.

_Contextual rules_ can now better be expressed using dynamic
rules. Local uses of contextual rules can also be defined using a
local traversal. See the paper 'Strategic Pattern Matching' for a
discussion of translation of contextual rules that can be applied by
hand.

_Literate programming comments_ such as
<verbatim>
\begin{code}
  foo = ...
\end{code}
</verbatim>
are no longer supported. Use standard comment delimiters instead.

Other constructs that are discontinued are _strategy rules_ of
the form
<verbatim>
L :: s1 --> s2
</verbatim>
The thread traversal operator (can be expressed in the library),
and threading and distributing congruence operators.

---------++ Stratego Core Compiler

The Stratego compiler now compiles programs according to the
Stratego-Sugar syntax definition. The front-end of the compiler is
drastically refactored and simplified. The optimizer has been disabled
in this release. Migration and improvement of the optimizer has been
planned for release 0.15.4.

---------+++ Format Checking

The compiler monitors its own integrity by checking the format of
intermediate results against subsets of the Regular Tree Grammar of
the complete syntax definition. By default checks are only carried out
at a few places, to save compile time. In case an error occurs, the
level of checking can be increased using the =--format-check= option
of strc.

---------+++ List Variables

The treatment of list variables is cleaned up by improving their
assimilation in meta-explode. This has made it possible to have fewer
compiler components be aware of list variables. If list variables in
concrete syntax quotations should be used as list variables outside
those quotations as well, they should have a * suffix. See issue
STR-321.

Realization of this clean-up required a bugfix in implode-asfix and a
change in the assimilation of concrete syntax, which entails that
Conc(ts1,ts2) is now used as a special constructor to denote the
concatenation of two lists. In particular, if Conc(ts1,ts2) is used in
a build, this is interpreted as <conc>(ts1, ts2). In other words Conc,
cannot be used as a normal constructor.

---------++ Stratego Library

The definition of collect-all with a skip has been adapted to recurse
to the current term instead of the children of current term in the
case of application of the skip strategy.

(Report by Ron de Bruijn, Fix by Martin Bravenboer)
 	  
The string concatenation strategy =conc-strings= now supports tuples
of more than 2 strings.

---------++ Tools

---------+++ GPP

=pptable-diff= now takes the arity of constructors into account.

(Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ Stratego-regular

The implementation of =sig2rtg= was not compatible with the new
Stratego syntax. Since the tool does not seem to be used, migration
has been deferred.

(Eelco Visser)


---------++ StrategoXT Deployment and Build System

---------+++ Build order of stratego-front and stratego-lib

The build order of stratego-front and stratego-lib has been swapped in
case of a baseline build. The modules in the library should be parsed
with the local syntax definition of Stratego, instead of the syntax
definition of the baseline. Since the library should be used with the
compiler in the current package, it should be compatible with that
compiler and use the same syntax definition. When bootstrapping
(building from a pre-compiled source tarball), the build-order is
reversed since the library is needed for the compilation of the
components in stratego-front. Also in the case of a bootstrap build,
xtc is built before stratego-front.
