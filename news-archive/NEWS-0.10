---------++ Dynamic Rules 

For StrategoXT 0.10 we have completely redesigned and reimplemented
dynamic rules. Scoped dynamic rewrite rules have been introduced in
Stratego 0.6 (August 2001). Dynamic rules have been applied
extensively since then. In particular they have proved to be very
useful for implementing context-sensitive transformations. However,
these applications also revealed some missing features in scoped
dynamic rewrite rules.

---------+++ Motivation for Redesign

First, there is a need for forking and merging sets of dynamic rules
in data-flow optimizations and probably many other application
areas. At first we have implemented this at the implementation level
of dynamic rules. In StrategoXT 0.10 this functionality has been lifted
to the language level by allowing intersection and union operations on
sets of rules.

Second, many applications need to define more than one possible rewrite
rules that can all be applied, possibly all at once to retrieve a list
of possible rewrites. A first implementation of this idea was already
available in StrategoXT 0.9.4 (extend rules).

Third, the 'override rules' facility for defining dynamic in rules in
outer scopes proved to be insufficient. To this end we have added
labeled scopes. Rules can be tied to specifically labeled scopes. Labeled
scopes are based on an idea raised by Ganesh Sittampalam in a discussion
at the Stratego User Days 2004.

---------+++ New Syntax and Semantics

The new abstract syntax is introduced by comparing to the old syntax and
and semantics, and is presented in BNF below. Some basic entities are:
<verbatim>
  s     strategy,
  f     rule/strategy identifier, e.g. 'EvalBinOp', or 'innermost',
  dsig  definition signature, identifier with optional strategy and term
        arguments: f(sd*|vd*).
</verbatim>

Generation of new rules always occurred within =override/extend rules(..)=
constructs. Now, just one =rules(..)= construct is available. The dynamic
rule definitions within determine the semantics.

<verbatim>
  s ::= rules(drd*)                       rule definition block
</verbatim>

---------++++ Labeling of Scopes

To prevent rules from being undefined too early at the end of the current
scope, the =override rules(..)= could be used in the past. Rules were tied
to some outer scope, instead of the current innermost.

The new dynamic rules still support the same scoping syntax, but now
*optional* labels maybe attached. These labels are term-patterns, and thus
result in runtime scope-labeling.

<verbatim>
  s ::= {| f1(.p1)?, ... fn(.pn)? : s |}  dynamic rule scope
</verbatim>

Within a =rules(..)= block, the current scope may be assigned additional
labels.
<verbatim>
  drd ::= f+p                             label current scope
</verbatim>

---------++++ Dynamic Rule Definitions

Besides the mandatory rule name, dynamic rule definitions now may also
contain a label, specifying in which scope this rule should be placed.
No label naturally means generation within the current inner scope.
<verbatim>
  drsig ::= sig                           relative to current scope
            sig.p                         relative to labeled scope
            sig+p                         relative to current scope, but add a
                                          label to current scope simultaneously

  drd ::= drsig : p1 -> p2 (where s)?     dynamic rule definition
</verbatim>

Instead of =extend rules= blocks, now the rule definitions specify themselves
whether 'extend-behavior' is intended:
<verbatim>
  drd ::= drsig :+ p1 -> p2 (where s)?    dynamic rule extension
</verbatim>

Undefining rules no longer uses the =Undefined= keyword, again it's the
rule definition itself.
<verbatim>
  drd ::= drsig :- p                      dynamic rule undefining
</verbatim>

A new form of dynamic rule is the dynamic identity rule, that -when applied-
tries to match against the left-hand side and leaves the current term
untouched.
<verbatim>
  drd ::= drsig : p                       dynamic identity rule definition
</verbatim>

Within a nested scope-structure, multiple scopes may have identical labels.
When (un-)defining dynamic rules in a labeled scope, the innermost scope with
that label is selected.

---------++++ Dynamic Rule Calling

Dynamic rules are basically just runtime generated rewriting rules, so for a
definition: =UsedInExp :+ |[ x ]| -> |[ e ]|= the basic call is:
<verbatim>
  <UsedInExp> |[ y ]| => |[ e' ]|         // Normal rewriting
</verbatim>
It tries to rewrite with the most recently generated instance of =UsedInExp=,
and repeatedly tries older instances until rewriting succeeds or no more
instances exist in the same generation scope (i.e. no inheritance from higher
scopes than the one of latest generation).
Note that the semantics of this simple rewriting has changed: in the old model,
no older instances were available for rewriting if the youngest instance failed)

Two special rules are automatically available for each dynamic rule:
the =bagof-= and =once-= rule.
<verbatim>
  <bagof-UsedInExp> |[ y ]| => |[ e* ]|   // Multiple rewritings
</verbatim>
=bagof-RuleName= applies all available instances of =RuleName= (from one scope)
and returns a list of succeeded result terms.

<verbatim>
  <once-UsedInExp> |[ y ]| => |[ e' ]|    // Rewriting once
</verbatim>
=once-RuleName= rewrites just like =RuleName= would do, but upon successful
rewriting that rule instance is removed. A generated rule thus is used for
rewriting only once.

---------++++ Branching and Meeting Rule Sets

When performing control-flow optimizations, rule sets had to be explicitly
saved, intersected and restored. The new model now provides some variants for
this at the language level (with generic functionality available in the API).

The best-known branch-meet operation is the intersection of rule sets after
constant propagation through the then- and else-branch of an if-then-else.
The general syntax allows two strategies to be performed, followed by an
automatic intersection of one or more named rule sets:
<verbatim>
  s1 / f1, ..., fn \ s2                   dynamic rule intersection
</verbatim>
Example: =If(id,s,id)/PropConst\If(id,id,s)=

The same is possible for union, instead of intersection:
<verbatim>
  s1 \ f1, ..., fn / s2                   dynamic rule union
</verbatim>

Control structures that involve repetition (e.g. for-loops) often need
repeated traversal until a fixed point in the rule set is reached.
Two fixpoint traversals are available that meet the dynamic rule set with
the one from the previous iteration until the rule set is free of changes.
<verbatim>
  / f1, ..., fn \* s2                     dynamic rule fixpoint intersection
  \ f1, ..., fn /* s2                     dynamic rule fixpoint union
</verbatim>
Example: =/PropConst\* While(s,s)=

---------++++ Dynamic Rules API

For in-depth specification of the underlying dynamic rules implementation,
please refer to the =dynamic-rules-refactored= module in the SSL.
At least the debug strategies are useful for end-users:
<verbatim>
  dr-debug-rule-set(|name)                // Output dynamic rule set on stderr
  dr-debug-rule-set(|name, msg)           // Id. preceded by user's message
</verbatim>

---------++++ Compatibility and Compiler Flags

The new implementation of dynamic rules is not yet turned on by
default. To turn it on, you need to pass the option =--dr new= to the
Stratego compiler. Although the new implementation is not yet used by
default, all existing applications should work with the new
implementation. That is, if they do not rely on weird semantics in the
old dynamic rule implementation and do not manipulate the internal
representation of dynamic rules.

Parsing of stratego source always uses the new syntax, but for backward
compatibility *all* old constructs are still available.
That is: =extend/override rules(..)= and =Rule: t -> Undefined=.
When the new dynamic rule implementation is selected (=--dr new=), the old
semantics are emulated for both constructs. All other old dynamic rules
constructs still fit within the new implementation.
Note however, that semantics for simple rule application within the new
dynamic rules implementation has changed (see 'Dynamic Rule Calling' above).

The other way around: the new syntax for dynamic rules is supported as much
as possible by the old dynamic rule implementation.
Dynamic rule extension (e.g. =Rule :+ t1 -> t2=), and dynamic rule undefining
(e.g. =Rule :- t=) are translated to their old equivalents.
When the input program contains scope-labels or identity rules, the compiler
warns and exits with an error.
But realize: when using new constructs in your program, there's no need to use
the old compiler implementation.

We advice to test compiling your programs with =--dr new= since future
releases of the Stratego compiler will have this flag switched on by default.

---------++ If then else and switch operators

StrategoXT 0.10 introduces a if-then-else and switch operators. Both
operators are defined in terms of the guarded left-choice. Thus, they
are just a more wordy syntax that can be clearer in some case.

The if operator is translated into Stratego-Core by the following
rewrite rule:

<verbatim>
  |[ if s1 then s2 else s3 end ]| -> |[ where(s1) < s2 + s3 ]|
</verbatim>

Note that the application of s1 does not change the subject term. s2
and s3 are applied to the subject term of the if-then-else operator.

The translation of the switch statement is somewhat more complex. It
is best introduced with an example.

The following code fragment from pack-sdf:
<verbatim>
  (  where(of-config => "txt")   < xtc-asfix-yield
  +  where(of-config => "ast")   < xtc-implode-asfix
  +  where(of-config => "asfix")
     <+ <fatal-error> ["pack-sdf: ", <id>, " is not a valid output format."]
  )
</verbatim>

translates into the following code if the switch operator is used:

<verbatim>
  switch of-config
    case "txt"   : xtc-asfix-yield
    case "ast"   : xtc-implode-asfix
    case "asfix" : id
    otherwise    :
      <fatal-error> ["pack-sdf: ", <id>, " is not a valid output format."]
  end
</verbatim>

The case conditions (="txt"=, ="ast"= and ="asfix"=) are not
restricted to term patterns: arbitrary strategies are allowed. They
are applied to the result of the subject of the switch, which is the
result of invoking =of-config= in this case.

The bodies (=xtc-asfix-yield=, =xtc-implode-asfix=, =id= and the
=fatal-error= invocation) are applied to the subject term of the
switch strategy. That is, the switch subject and the conditions do not
modify the subject term, which is comparable to the behaviour of the
if operator.

The words used in these new operators (=if=, =then=, =else=, =end=,
=switch=, =case= and =otherwise=) are not declared as
keywords. Therefore they are still allowed as identifiers.

---------++ Updated of XT

For StrategoXT 0.10 we have updated many XT tools that are part of
StrategoXT. Unfortunately, many SDF Tools, but even the Stratego
Tools, have not been kept up-to-date with respect to the languages
they operate on in the last few years.

The SDF tools have all been updated to the most recent version of
SDF2, which is the one in in PGEN 2.0. There are quite some SDF tools
in StrategoXT, but the most relevant ones are _ppgen_, the
pretty-print table generator, _pack-sdf_, for collecting SDF modules
in a single definition, and _sdf-cons_, for adding constructors to SDF
productions. The tool sdf-to-sig, for generating Stratego Signatures
from an SDF syntax definition is no longer available. It has been
replaced by tools available in Stratego Regular.

If you have yourself developed SDF tools based on StrategoXT, then you
might need to upgrade your tools. The previous versions of StrategoXT
used to ship with three versions of SDF. _SDF 2.1_, which was named
=Sdf2-Syntax=, an older version of SDF, which was named =sdf= or
=sdf.cons=, and the most recent one, which is called =Sdf2=. This last
version is the only one that is left in StrategoXT 0.10. If your tools
use one of the older versions of SDF, then you need to update
them. Most SDF tools only have to change the top-level constructor
names, which are now completely lower-case. If you need more
information on upgrading issues, then just sent e-mail to the
stratego-dev mailing list.

  (Martin Bravenboer and Valentin David)

AsFix Tools has been cleanup as well. The definition of AsFix in this
package was not very clear and the package used to contain signatues
for SDF modules, which have now been removed in StrategoXT 0.10. The
SDF signatures of the most recent SDF2 are part of the SDF Front
package. The signature for =asfix= has been replaced by a new
signature, now called =AsFix=. This module defines the AsFix language
in a single signature. If you import this module, then your program
can handle all AsFix constructs.

  (Martin Bravenboer)

The Stratego Tools package has been updated to use the latest
definitions of Stratego in stratego-front. The existing tools in
Stratego Tools are not really heavily used, so you will probably never
have experienced any problems.

Stratego Tools in StrategoXT 0.10 contains a new tool,
=pp-stratego-latex-alltt=. This tool is useful for including Stratego
code in publications and documentation written LaTeX. The tool adds
some macro invocations to a Stratego module, while preserving the
layout of the code. Currently it marks quotation symbols,
meta-variables, and dynamic rule scope. It escapes characters that
have a special meaning in the alltt environment. You can define the
macros yourself, so you can completely control the presentation of the
marked constructs. The source directory of the tool contains an
example LaTeX document.

---------++ Support for Cygwin and Mac OS X

In the meantime we have added a Cygwin machine to our buildfarm. In
this way we can make sure that StrategoXT is working on Cygwin. Since
no of our Stratego contributors is using Cygwin, signaling problems
with Cygwin used to be a problem in the past. Testing StrategoXT now
and then on Cygwin was not sufficient.

  (Martin Bravenboer)

StrategoXT 0.10 also supports the most recent Mac OS X release. This
is mostly thanks to the updates of the development tools for Mac OS
X. We are looking forward to reports of Mac OS X users, especially
concerning the performance of StrategoXT. In particular, if someone
has access to a G5, then it would be great to hear some experiences.

---------++ Editor Support

Shishir Ramam contributed Vim syntax files for Stratego and SDF. These
files are available in the stratego-util package, which is part of
StrategoXT.

Arthur van Dam has implemented SDF and Stratego syntax highlighting
patterns for NEdit. These are available in stratego-util as well.

---------++ Many bug fixes and minor improvements

Just before the release of StrategoXT 0.9.5 we adopted the JIRA issue
tracking system. JIRA has been very helpful in keeping track of
problems. In particular many small problems have been fixed in this
release, which would typically have been forgotten before we adopted
JIRA. Please report any issues to JIRA, even if you think that it is
not that important, or if you have already found a workaround. Any
annoyance is welcome! Feedback of users is very important in adding
the finishing touch to our tools.
