StrategoXT 0.14 -- released May, 2005

---------++!! Summary of Changes

StrategoXT 0.14, which represents over 3 months of development,
features a wide variety of updates. A few highlights are wildcard
imports in Stratego, the hierarchical Stratego library, the
introduction of pkg-config and much more.

%TOC%

---------++ Stratego Language

---------+++ Wildcard imports

We have introduced wildcard imports to allow easy importing of
multiple modules in the same package/directory.

<verbatim>
  imports strategy/-
</verbatim>

The import statement above instructs the compiler/interpreter to
import all Stratego files from the directory 'strategy', relative to
the include paths.

---------+++ Dependent Dynamic Rules

There has been a change in dynamic rules terminology. When defining a
dependent dynamic rule, strategies =kill-R= and =new-R(|_)= were defined
by the compiler. Since we also use the term `undefine' for, well,
undefining rules, it is more consistent to use =undefine-R= instead of
=kill-R=.

=new-R= and =undefine-R= now take all their arguments as term arguments.
Thus, =new-R(|x,x)= and =undefine-R(|x)= instead of =<new-R(|x)> x= and
=<undefine-R> x=. This entails that there is no need to wrap these
invocations in =where= clauses anymore.

Remaining (JIRA) issues concerning dynamic rules: STR-251, STR-269,
STR-275.

Please note that Dependent Dynamic Rules still have the experimental
status in Stratego. Even though they are stabilizing, changes in
semantics can occur in next versions.

---------++ Stratego Compiler

---------+++ strc

Since the introduction of the new style dynamic rules in StrategoXT
0.11, strc had an option for choosing the semantics of dynamic rules.
From this version on, the default semantics are the new
semantics. ('--dr new' by default)

As optimization levels below 2 are broken (see STR-15), we have
disabled them. If one chooses an optimization level below 2, a warning
will be shown and the optimization level will be set to 2. The problem
of broken optimizations are being addressed in the strc-core package,
which holds the new version of the Stratego compiler.

---------+++ pack-stratego 

The packing process has been altered to improve the error reporting of
pack-stratego, similar to the error reporting of pack-sdf.

The '--imports' flag has been removed from pack-stratego.

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------++ Stratego Library

----------+++ Hierarchical structure

We have started changing the Stratego library to a hierarchical
structure. The new structure should make it easier to find strategies
in the Stratego library.

Example: 
<verbatim>
    module strategy/collect
</verbatim>

The initial packages and their modules are:

   * lang
      * dynamic-rules, dynamic-rules-refactored, scoped-finite-map
   * strategy
      * collect, conditional, iteration
   * strategy/traversal
      * environment, fixpoint, list, list-environment, simple
   * strategy/general
      * free-variables, option, parenthesize, rename, substitution,
        unification
   * strategy/pack
      * common, graph, modules
   * system/io
      * char, dir, exec, file, pipe, process, term
   * system/posix
      * error, file, process, signal
   * term
      * annotation, common, integer, placeholder, properties, real,
        share, string, zip
   * collection/hash-table
      * common, nested
   * collection/tuple
      * common, cons
   * collection/set
      * indexed
   * collection/list
      * bag, common, cons, filter, index, integer, lookup, set, sort,
        zip
   * util
      * date-format, log, sunit, time
   * util/config
      * common, cpl, keep, options, parse-options, verbose

For compatibility reasons, the old modules are still
distributed. These modules only contains imports to the corresponding
modules above. It is expected that these modules will be removed from
the distribution at the next release.

----------+++ Verbose

We have changed the default verbosity level to 1 (one). Previously
this was 0 (zero). 

From this release on the verbosity can be set using any of the
following verbose level descriptors:

   * emergency, alert, critical, error, info, warning, notice, debug,
     vomit

E.g.
<verbatim>
   $ sglri ... --verbose debug ...
</verbatim>

These descriptors translate to the verbosity levels as described in the
=util/log= module of the Stratego library.

---------++ StrategoXT Deployment and Build System

---------+++ Baseline development

The Stratego/XT source code highly depends on itself: Stratego and
various generative tools are used everywhere. Previously we had
bootstrapped sources in the repository. We have changed to a system
where we are using a baseline to compile a Stratego/XT source tree
from Subversion.

The big advantage of a baseline is that you basically cannot break
anything.  In the past, we used bootstrapped sources in the Subversion
repository, which was very fragile and required great care of
contributors. The baseline setup is much easier to use and more
safe. We hope this will encourage contributions.

More information on contributing to StrategoXT and working with a
baseline can be found at:

    (Martin Bravenboer)

---------+++ pkg-config

In this release we have introduced pkg-config for locating packages
and their configuration. The use of pkg-config has several advantages:

   * Distributions of packages that have been created using a certain
     Stratego/XT are more likely to work on future versions of
     Stratego/XT. Thus, package don't have to be re-distributed if a
     new Stratego/XT comes out.

   * Users of packages that use Stratego/XT don't need to configure
     this package with the location of Stratego/XT. Pkg-config is used
     to find the location of Stratego/XT on the system of the user.

   * Internally, the installation of Stratego/XT is less
     complicated. The installation of packages in the directory
     =local-baseline= is no longer necessary.

   * Users can use pkg-config to pass the right includes paths to the
     Stratego compiler.

---------++ StrategoXT Transformation Tools

---------+++ General

In the previous release we added the =log= (previously =logging=)
module in the Stratego library. We have started adapting the 
existing tools to use these logging facilities, to allow cleaner
and more uniform messages from the tools.

    (Rob Vermaas)

---------+++ pp-aterm

The default behaviour of the pp-aterm tool has changed. Previously the
tool showed strings unescaped. This makes the pretty printed terms
easier to read, but results in a malformed ATerm in cases where there 
are characters that need escaping.

The =pp-aterm= tool now escapes the '\', '"', '\n', '\t' and '\r'
characters by default. If you prefer the old behaviour you can pass the 
=-u= or =--unescaped= flag to =pp-aterm=.
