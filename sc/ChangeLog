2001-11-15  Merijn de Jonge <mdejonge@cwi.nl>
	* Updated dependencies in sc-0.6.3.pkg

2001-10-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.2

2001-10-01  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Changed constructor Operations into Constructors

2001-09-28  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: No type annotations were added for
	congruences generated from overlays.

2001-09-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6.1

2001-09-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: all-defs and needed-defs share the
	call to graph packing strategy.

2001-09-15  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/c/s2c.r: Reading tracing options and generating traced C code.

	* spec/sig/Stratego-Normal-Format.r: Recognizing congruence operators with
	modifiers.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Handling tracing options and passing them on to s2c

2001-08-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Release 0.6

	* Ensure that sc and ac2c are made executable before installation

2001-08-23  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Removing intermediate files

2001-08-22  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* Correction of paths to library

	* SCBOOT dependency in configure specifies where to install
	bootstrapped C sources.	

	* Restructuring of the source tree, new CVS repository. The
	Stratego library and the Stratego Run-time System have been split
	off into separate packages. The bootstrapped sources are also
	distributed in a separate package to avoid build dependency cycles
	(the compiler is needed to compile some packages that are used by
	the compiler itself, i.e., GPP).

	* New implementation scheme. The compiler now produces idiomatic,
	high-level C code instead of abstract machine code. The
	implementation uses the CGEN package for pretty-printing the C
	code.

	* The optimizer has been extended a bit. 
	
	* The tests in the test/ directory have been cleaned up and moved
	to spec/test1 and spec/test2. The tests have been extended while
	developing the new compilation scheme to get a better coverage of
	the language.

	* Arguments of strategy definitions can now be given a type
	annotation.  This is required for higher-order arguments. The
	default type is (term -> term).

2001-07-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/c/: New translation scheme

2001-06-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-misc.r: Bug in drop-while, drop-until;

	* spec/front/normalize-spec.r: Added overriding dynamic rules that
	change the definition for the currently active key without
	introducing an entry in the local scope. This is needed to update
	rules defined in outer scopes. (Application: dead code
	elimination)
	
2001-06-17  Eelco Visser <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/front/normalize-spec.r: Repaired bug in desugaring
	of "Undefined" dynamic rules.

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Allow \begin{code} to start file.

2001-06-14  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/front/normalize-spec.r: Dynamic rules that have Undefined
	as right-hand side will cause the invocation of the dynamic rule
	(on the specific lhs pattern) to fail. This is needed in order to
	shadow rules from outer scopes that might not be applicable.

2001-06-13  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* src/make_rules.in (CC): Declare as @CC@ instead of gcc.

	* spec/slib/spec/string-test.r, string.r: get-path extracts the
	path prefix from a command string.

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: Deduce path for parse-mod from path
	for pack-stratego (from command-line option 0).

2001-06-10  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/src/tables.c: Made table access more robust; there is

	operations

2001-06-09  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	definition can now be defined under both the rules and strategies
	keywords. In effect, rules and strategy definitions can be mixed
	in any order.

2001-06-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/string.r: Repaired basename to correctly

 2001-05-20    <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/iteration.r: Import conditional

	* spec/slib/spec/conditional.r: Else branch of if is not
	called when the then branch fails, only when the condition
	fails. (Using cut construct from RhoStratego.)

2001-05-18    <visser@acm.org>

	* src/front/Makefile.am (inline_SOURCES): inline.c instead of
	inlining.c. This caused bug in (not) renaming of let
	expressions. (Thanks Arne de Bruijn)

	* new module: char.r for character strategies. includes
	  char-test.r

2001-04-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/tables.r, display.r: Reorganized and documented
	the tables modules. The strategies formerly in the display module

	Names have been normalized. Many operators have become obsolete.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/term-zip.r: Generic definition of zipping
	two term structures; can be used to implement pattern matching
	for example. 

	* spec/slib/spec/scoped-finite-map.r: Keeping track of scopes of
	table entries. Removing entries from tables is done automatically
	when the scope is exited. This is a candidate for support at the
	language level.
	
2001-03-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Repaired bug in nrofoccs (Arne de

	where not used in libraries (rts and slib) by wrong use of
	automake variables. (Arne de Bruijn)

	* Makefile.am: Renamed boot.log to bootlog to avoid removal
	by clean scripts.

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Repaired some typos and refactored
	several strategies

2001-03-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: New strategy iowrapO/3 is also
	parameterized with a strategy for printing usage

	requires a line localhost="localhost" in the platforms file.

2001-03-23  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* build/BuildLocalDist: Added FreeBSD platform such that cvs build
	can use this buildfile to test the distribution

	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): explicitly call stratego script for each
	test.

	* src/: bootinstall

	libraries instead of debug libraries.
	
	* spec/sc/sc.in: Include optimized libraries instead of debug
	libraries.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: Removed debug statement printing
	dependency file

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Coercion for list of strategies argument
	of Let.

	early in process (dist should not depend on installation). Write
	.stat files to build.log files to monitor performance.

	* doc/tutorial/exercises/pico/spec: Distribution was dependent on
	existence of si. Repaired by including dumping of modules as
	tests.

	module2.r to distribution

	* build/BuildFromCVS: Added checkdist action

	* build/build: Program for building software given script with
	configurations (The program is written by Merijn de Jonge and is
	distributed independently. It is added to stratego to keep
	self-contained.)

	* doc/*/Makefile.am: HTML documentation is not made automatically
	and not included in the distribution.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Documentation should be made three times to get
	table of contents and references right

	* share/tex/stop-article.cls: STOP style for articles

	* spec/slib/spec/abox-ext.r: changed space options to strings

	* bench/fib: Fibonacci benchmark

	* doc/tutorial/exercises: directory with exercises for learning
	Stratego

	* README.in: improvements to the readme

	* build/Makefile.am: Adding build directory to distribution

	* doc/script: Report about StrategoScript

	* test/parser/parser.r: operations -> constructors

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: Declaration of constructor
	Include (Merijn de Jonge)	

	* spec/back/specialized.r: Removed specialization rules for fetch
	and oncetd; the rules optimized the behaviour of these strategies
	in case the argument strategy was only a test. The test for
	determining whether this is the case was not correct. This caused
	bugs in some applications (CobolX in particular). Thanks to Hedzer
	Westra for noting this bug. Effects analysis is needed to do this
	correctly.
	
2001-03-13  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: Apply desugaring after generating
	code for congruence.

	constructor symbols used in building terms using same mechanism as
	is used for caching symbols in matching patterns. (Arne de Bruijn)

2001-03-12  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/src/string.c: Bug in string-implode: no allocation of
	nul characters at end of string for strings of length 1024.
	Repaired by Arne.

	* spec/slib: Patch of library by Arne adding string to real
	conversion + some refactorings.

2001-02-25  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* doc/*/: Improved translation of manuals by HTML; it is possible
	to go through entire document without going up.

2001-02-03  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/tables.r: Changed create-table and destroy-table
	to table-create and table-destroy for consistency with other table
	strategies (suggested by Merijn).

2001-02-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	StrategoScript.

	* spec/opt/bind-laws.r: in -> 'in

	* spec/front/frontend.r: Moved frontend phases from extract to
	frontend. Frontend now produces a list of core language strategy
	definitions. Extract extracts needed definitions.  This means that
	frontend can be used in other contexts to get all definitions for
	a module.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Strategy output-frontend extracts andjoins
	all definitions and writes them to a .sdefs file for use by other
	tools.

	* spec/front/extract-all.r: Calls all-defs as separate component.

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: Added all-defs strategy that extracts
	all definitions; this means that it joins definitions for the
	same name/arity.

2001-01-29  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: Adapted pack-stratego such that
	it can also read generated modules in abstract syntax form.
	If no .r file is found for a module, pack-stratego looks for
	a .tree file and assumes that it contains an ATerm in the
	form that would be produced by parse-mod.

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Moved obsolete strategies to
	subs-obsolete.r

	* spec/si/primitives.r: The program primitives extracts the
	definitions of primitives from a strategy specification in
	abstract syntax form. It generates a module (in abstract syntax)
	with evaluation rules for the interpreter, which interpret the
	application of Prim(p) to a term for the primitive defined.

	* configure.in: Bumped the version number to 0.5; the next release
	will contain StrategoScript.

2001-01-28  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/simple-traversal.r: Added strategy alltd-fold,
	which is the same as alltd, but applies a second (folding)
	strategy after each traversal to direct subterms.

	* spec/slib/spec/fixpoint-traversal.r: Removed definition of
	innermost''' (?) which was defined in terms of the annotation
	operators @? and @!

2001-01-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Removed @?, @!, @/; they were meant for
	annotation manipulation, but that has never been implemented.
	Removed obsolete keywords match, build, operations.

	* spec/slib/spec/sunit.r: No longer print "failed" or "succeeded"
	messages when the test is succesful.

	* spec/slib/spec/display.r: Handling of stacks of bindings for
	variables by means of a hash-table. For each name a stack of
	bindings is maintained. Thus it is not necessary to do variable
	renaming.

2001-01-25  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Added syntax for local definition
	of strategy definitions let f(s) = ... in s

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Added keywords "in" and "let"

2001-01-24  Eelco Visser  <visser@acm.org>

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Adaptation of syntax

	* spec/slib/spec/free-variables.r: Adaptation of syntax

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Removed the syntax ?t <= s
	Too baroque. Go back to using s => t

2001-01-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@node11794.a2000.nl>

	* Release 0.4.22

	* Prepared release 0.4.22

2001-01-20  Eelco Visser  <visser@node11794.a2000.nl>

	* test/optimizations/*: testing the new fusion optimization
	component.

	* bootstrap + bootinstall

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Added option --fusion to turn
	on the new fusion component for optimizing the innermost
	strategy.

	* www/*: information about the second Stratego users day.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Added a new equality
	strategy with an additional filter that can be used for
	checking equality modulo alpha renaming. The filter applies
	to the entire pair and can change something in one
	term based on the other term.
	
	* spec/opt/bind-laws.r: Added inlining rules from module
	../front/inlining.

	* spec/front/inlining.r: Refactored specification of
	inlining. Moved contextual inlining rules to ../opt/bind-laws.r.
	Simplified the expansion strategy.
	
	* spec/opt/traversal-laws.r: empty module

	* spec/opt/strategy-patterns.r: Overlays for often occuring
	(abstract syntax) patterns in specifications such as Bottomup(s)

	* spec/opt/fusion-rules.r: Rules for innermost optimization.

	* spec/opt/fusion.r: Strategy for optimizing innermost strategy.

	* spec/opt/stratego-laws.r: Renamed rules to get more
	mnemonic names (AssociateR instead of Ass).

2001-01-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@node11794.a2000.nl>

	* test/io/typo.res: Forgot to add to repository

2000-11-13  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* www/documentation.html: References to
	www.stratego-language.org/ftp

	* www/download.html: Download distributions from
	www.stratego-language.org/ftp

	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Renamed foldr-kids to crush,
	following the paper by Joost and Ralf.

2000-11-06  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.21

2000-11-05  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* bench/prop/*: Repaired bugs.
	
	* www/maillist/: started stratego-developers mailinglist

	* distdiff: a shell script that computes the difference between
	distributions; to make lightweight patches. Contributed by Otto
	Bagge.

	* build/Buildfile: Buildfile that describes how to build the
	Stratego distribution and test it; script for the build program.

2000-11-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* test/overloading/Makefile.am (check2): Redirection &> xxx is not
	portable. Changed to 2>&1 | tee > xxx, which apparently is
	portable. Change by Merijn.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: Bugs in option handling fixed
	by Merijn de Jonge.

2000-11-01  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/rts/aterm-extension.c: Added a few casts to make the type
	system happy.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-sort.r: Refactored some rules replacing Cons
	notation with [ | ] notation.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Removed the utils directory from the
	distribution and the configuration because it was causing problems
	in building the distribution; the stratego compiler is required to
	make the utilities in the subdirectory. The utilities will now
	probably be distributed in a separate package that requires sc for
	building.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: Patch by Joost Visser.

2000-10-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* bootstrap, bootinstall
	
	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.r: Print call to DOIT at the end of the
	generated C files such that declarations of functions appear
	before it.

2000-10-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* build/: Directory with BuildFile for building installations of
	Stratego.

	* spec/back/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): ins_simplification.r no
	longer used.

	* spec, src: bootinstalled header files in stratego subdirectories.

	* bootstrap, bootinstall
	
	* spec/back/compiler.r: Handled assignments of real constants
	to variables.

	* spec/slib/spec/data: directory for test data

2000-10-29  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/src/term.c (_mkterm): Replaced ATmatch with ATgetType.

	* spec/slib/src/number.c: Using ATmatch with pattern <real> caused
	a strange error in the calling procedure (value of variable
	overwritten). Changed to using ATgetType, which should be faster
	as well.

	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.r: Added printing of real constants.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-misc.r: thread-map threads an environment
	through a list and applies a strategy to each element with the
	environment.

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: Added congruence-thread definition
	generation for constructors without arguments.

	* spec/rts, spec/slib/src, src/rts, src/slib/src: Added stratego
	subdirectories that contain the local include files that are
	included by the main include files stratego.h, stratego-lib.h and
	stratego-ext.h. These include files are installed at
	$(prefix)/include/stratego, in order to avoid clashes with other
	packages. (Thanks to Otto Bagge for the suggestion)
	
	* spec/back/compiler.r: Added support for building constructor
	applications with more than 6 arguments. (Thanks to Otto Bagge for
	the patch.)

2000-10-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.20

2000-10-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* bootstrap, bootinstall
	
	* spec/back/compiler.r: Repaired bug: double quotes or escapes in
	strings were reduced one escape level. Repaired by escaping such
	strings.

	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.r: Removed workaround for the above bug.

2000-10-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.19
	
	* bootstrap, bootinstall

2000-10-07  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/src/tables.c (lookup_table): Store table pointers
	directly in ST_table_table by coercing the pointer to an int. The
	previous method used a fixed size array of size 100 to store table
	pointers. Since table numbers were not garbage collected a program
	could run out of tables. By storing the table pointers directly,
	tables are garbage collected automatically (after destruction with
	destroy-table).
	
2000-09-29  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.18
	
	* spec/slib/spec/tables.r: New operations for handling tables,
	especially useful for symbol table management.

2000-09-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/, src/: bootinstall
	
	* spec/match/: Improved algorithmics of the pattern match compiler.

	* spec/, src/: bootinstall

2000-09-20  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/match/match-to-matrix.r: Defined merging of matrices also
	if not all elements of a choice or lchoice are matrices by merging
	adjacent matrices.

	* spec/opt/congruence-laws.r: Defined TransformingCongruence law
	that defines congruence in terms of matching and building. Needs
	to be improved before incorporation in the compiler.

	* spec/back/compiler.r: Defined matching of function symbol
	for congruence with TestFunTop that uses cached AFun. Removed
	obsolete code.

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Added strategy iowrapNoOutput that
	does not write the result term to the output file, instead leaving
	this to the wrapped strategy. This is useful for strategies that
	produce output by means of printing.

	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.r: Defined pretty-printing of
	instructions in Stratego (was implemented in C). Now easier to
	adapt.

	* spec/, src/: bootinstall

2000-09-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/back/, spec/rts/: Caching of AFuns: function matching is
	now done by comparing the AFun number of a term instead of string
	matching on its symbol. All function symbols occurring in a
	program are cached in global variables. This should reduce
	run-time of specifications.

	* spec/back/, spec/rts/: Each (nullary) strategy definition is
	compiled to its own C function. (This reduces C compile time and
	memory usage.)

2000-09-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* www/style.css: Changed color of bold from blue to black.

	* spec/slib/spec/ugly-print.r: Changed Quote' to Quote: outer "s
	should not be escaped.

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Removed obsolete code

2000-09-04  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/, src/: bootinstall

2000-09-03  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/: New implementation of pattern match compilation works.

2000-09-02  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/: New implementation of pattern match compilation and term
	building.

2000-08-31  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/front/desugar.r: Defined desugaring of Lets

	* spec/sig/sugar.r: Added constructor Lets that is sugar for
	a chain of Let's.

2000-08-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/*: Added primitive is-real for testing if a term is
	a real number.

	* spec/match/matrix.r: New implementation of matching automaton
	derivation based on the ideas of Mikael Pettersson in his paper "A
	Term Pattern-Match Compiler Inspired by Finite Automat Theory".

	* spec/slib/spec/list-basic.r: Changed upto such that it counts
	from 0 (instead of 1) upto the given number.

2000-08-29  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* utils/metrics/Makefile.am (SCFLAGS): Utilities are compiled
	before the library is installed

2000-08-27  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-misc.r: Added mapfoldr1

	* Release 0.4.17

	* spec/, src/: bootinstall

	* spec/slib/spec/string.r: Strategy escape puts \ before 
	special characters such as \ and ".

	* utils/metrics/: Added measurement of number of constructors.

2000-08-26  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/ugly-print.r: Strategy ugly-print pretty-prints
	an ATerm literally, but indents arguments such that it becomes
	readable.

2000-08-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* utils/metrics/: Measuring simple metrics of Stratego
	specifications.  Currently measures the number of rules and
	strategies in each module in a list of modules.

	* utils/: Directory for auxiliary tools for processing Stratego
	specifications.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Dependency file for the target executable
	is generated (instead of for the default name for the executable,
	which is the name of the main module). Achieved by passing -dep
	option to pack-stratego.

2000-08-20  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-zip.r: Added rest-zip which returns a
	triple of the zipped list and the remainders of the two lists (one
	of which is empty).

	* spec/slib/spec/io.r: Added open and save for easier reading from
	and writing to files.

	* spec/slib/spec/abox-ext.r: Added post-commas to postfix commas
	after each element in a list. Redefined hpost-sep-list to not postfix
	a separator after the last element.

2000-08-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Generic equality testing
	parameterized with a filter that throws away parts of the terms
	that can be ignored.

2000-08-18  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-basic.r: New strategy split-fetch, splits
	a list in two at the point where the argument strategy succeeds.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-basic-test.r: Test of split-fetch

	* spec/slib/spec/sunit.r: New tests: apply-test/3 only tests
	whether application succeeds, apply-and-check applies a strategy
	to the result of the application to verify it.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Added new intermediate files to list of
	files to be removed.

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Updated substitution strategy

2000-08-17  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/opt/optimization.r: Repaired rule to correctly use
	|tsubs|.

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: Removed |boxedfigure| environment
	from documentation. (Should add more documentation.)

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Adapted |ExpOverlay| to new
	definition substitution.

	* spec/front/normalize-spec.r: Refactored definition of
	|vars-to-consts| and removed obsolete code.

	* spec/front/inlining.r: Changed Cons syntax to [|]. Changed
	explicit use of library strategy subs to use of ssubs.

	* spec/front/Makefile.am: Added extract and inline to CLEANFILES.

	* spec/lib/stratlib.r: Removed obsolete code for renaming and
	refactored definitions of |tsubs| and |ssubs| to use the
	|substitute| strategy.

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Refactored the definition of
	substitution and marked all old definitions (subs etc.) as
	obsolete. Wrote an explanation of the different versions of
	the strategy. There are now two parameters for indicating
	variable shape; one for that maps a variable to whatever	
	the domain of the substitution is and another that indicates
	the shape of a variable and the actual name of the variable
	(for the purpose of renaming).

2000-08-16  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Moved definition of |in|
	(occurrence testing) to this module from substitution.r

	* reconf: Now creates the dependency files that are included in
	Makefile.am's, but that shouldn't be included in the CVS
	repository because that would memoize wrong dependencies.

2000-07-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.16

	* spec/slib/spec/sunit.r: Added the apply-and-fail test
	that succeeds if the test fails.

2000-06-30  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* www/*: Refreshed the web site layout.

2000-06-25  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Removed sglr.r and gpp.r from the library. They should be
	defined in a Stratego library (associated) with distributions
	for these tools.

2000-06-24  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.15

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: Changes by Joost Visser, adding
	a commandline option to set the name of the dependency file.

	* spec/slib/spec/io.r: trace(msg, s) prints msg before doing s and
	reports success or failure afterwards.

2000-06-23  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/list-index.r: Changed Cons into [|]

2000-06-21  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* share/emacs/Makefile.am (pkgdata_DATA): Install emacs configuration
	file in share/stratego directory.

2000-06-20  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* rpm/*: Scripts for producing redhat package manager archives
	(rpms)

	* Changes for frontend split

2000-06-19  Eelco Visser  <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src: bootinstall

	* spec/front/use-def.r: Added spec-use-defIO to make standalone
	tool.

	* spec/front/check-constructors.r: Added CheckConstructorsIO to
	make standalone tool.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Added the components extract and inline
	that were split off from frontend.

	* spec/front/inlining.r: Added inlineIO strategy to make
	the inliner standalone.

	* spec/front/frontend.r: Split the frontend into the proper
	frontend that normalizes a specification and checks several
	properties, the extractor that extracts needed definitions and the
	inliner that inlines definitions. This was necessary because
	frontend.c took to long to compile (using to much memory) on my
	new Mandrake installing.

	* spec/front/extract.r: Part of the frontend concerned with
	extracting needed definitions and translating definitions into
	core language.

	* rpm/stratego.spec (Summary): 

2000-06-12    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.14

	* src/: bootinstall

	* www/: release 0.4.14

	* www/release/0.4.14.html: Description of changes in this release.

	* spec/slib/src/term.c (_mkterm): Added arity argument of MatchFunFC

	* spec/rts/svm.h (ThreadSetEnv): Added arity argument of MatchFun

	* spec/sig/instructions.r: MatchFun and MatchFunFC have additional
 	arity argument.

	* test/control/match-arity.r: Tests for matching against a pattern
	with the same function symbol but with different arity.

	* spec/rts/aterm-extension.c (consnil_to_list _shallow): Repaired
 	translation of Cons/Nil lists to ATerm lists. A Cons is produced
 	when the tail is not an ATerm list.

	* test/io/improper-list-test.r: Test of improper lists, i.e.,
 	where second argument of Cons is not a list and can thus not be
 	translated to ATerm lists. This used to lead to a segmentation
 	fault.  Now it just returns the Cons.
 
	* spec/pp/pp-instructions.c (pp): MatchFunFC has additional arity
	argument.

2000-06-11    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

 	constructors such that another declaration is sought if the one
 	found has the wrong arity.

	* spec/slib/src/tuples.c (MatchPair): Use of MatchFunFC with additional
	arity argument

	* spec/rts/svm.h (MatchFunFC): MatchFun and MatchFunFC with additional
	arity argument

	* spec/rts/stratego.c (_MatchFun): Implementation of MatchFun and
	MatchFunFC with additional arity argument. Test if arity of term
	constructor matches the given one.

	* spec/opt/simplification.r: Generate MatchFunA with additional
	arity argument

	* spec/opt/match-build.r: Generate MatchFunA with additional
	arity argument

	* spec/match/automaton.r: Generate MatchFunA with additional
	arity argument

	* spec/back/compiler.r: Implementation of changed MatchFunA

	* spec/match/matching-tree.r: Change MatchFunA so that it takes
 	the arity in addition to the name of the function.

	* test/overloading/overloading-constructors-test.r: Test for
 	overloaded constructors. eval-test6 led to a segmentation fault in
 	the old implementation because no distinction is made between
 	constructors with the same name but different arity.
	
	* src: bootinstall

	* ChangeLog, TODO, NEWS: Added build defaults in overlays

	* spec/sig/sugar.r: Declaration of BuildDefault constructor

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Definition of BuildDefault in 
	congruences.

	* spec/match/automaton.r: Definition of BuildDefault in matching
	positions (same as wildcard).

	* spec/back/compiler.r: Added rule to compile BuildDefault(t) in
	building positions.
	
	* spec/syn/stratego.grm (term): Syntax for BuildDefault is _ term.

	* test/syntax/overlay-test.r: Test of BuildDefault
	
	* TODO: Possible implementation scheme for dealing with unbound
	variables under backtracking.

2000-06-10    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Support for overloaded
 	overlays. First overlays in overlay definitions are expanded.

2000-06-09    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Added import of rename

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: Added import of env-traversal

 	substitute.

	* spec/lib/stratlib-test.r: Added test for new substitute algorithm.

	* spec/sig/sugar.r: Added declaration for LRule

	* test/syntax/overlay-test.r: Test for adding default build
 	patterns for overlays.

 	JoinDefs2.

	* doc/reference/rules.ltx (subsection{As Patterns}): Added
	short explanation of as pattern; should be integrated.

	* NEWS: Added announcement of as pattern

	* spec/sdf/Stratego-Sugar.sdf: Added syntax of as pattern

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Added syntax of as pattern

	* spec/match/automaton.r: Added rule for translating as patterns
	to matching automata.

	* spec/match/matching-tree.r: Changed obsolete keywords operations
	and build into constructors and match.

	* test/syntax/as-pattern.r: Test for new as patterns that allow
	binding a complex pattern also to a variable with x @ t.

2000-06-07    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* test/syntax/quoted-keywords.r: Test of identifier quoting
 	syntax.

	* ChangeLog, News, TODO, configure.in: Description of changes

	* doc/compiler/Makefile.am, doc/compiler/doc.ltx: Starting to
	clean up the compiler.

	* share/tex/stop-report.cls: Added definition for \part (creates bug
	in toc)

	* test/control/congruence-thread.r: Test for new language feature.

	* share/emacs/stratego.el: Added keywords and symbols to coloring
	lists.

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm.*: Removed generated files.

	* spec/slib/spec/sunit.r: Split the failure message of apply-test
 	in the obtained result and expected result.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-zip.r: Added tuple-zip and tuple-unzip,
 	which do the same as zip and unzip, but for tuples of arbitrary
 	length instead of pairs.

	* spec/slib/spec/io.r: Added error, which prints strings in list
 	to stderr. Difference with fatal-error is that it does not exit.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-misc.r: Variant of copy with a strategy
 	argument that is applied to the copied term. Useful only if the
 	strategy has a side-effect. For example, generating n new
 	variables.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-graph.r: Added graph-nodes-undef that
 	returns a list of nodes *and* a list of names that are undefined.
  	Can be used for error handling. For example, in needed definition
 	computation, all missing definitions can now be reported in one
 	run.

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Added token ^ (MODIFIER). Added primeid
 	token, i.e., tokens with preceding ' to escape keywords of the
 	language. These identifiers are identical to the identifiers
	without the '.

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Added syntax for threading and
 	distributing congruences.

	* doc/reference/strategies.ltx: Added sub section on Carrying
 	Information along a Traversal, i.e., threading and distributing
 	congruences.

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: Refactored the definition of needed
 	definition computation by using the graph-nodes strategy from the
 	library (which is also used for flattening modules). Added the
 	generation of distributing and threading congruence operators C^D
 	and C^T.

2000-06-05    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.13

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Reimplemented remove-intermediates in terms
	of rm-files

	* spec/slib/spec/exec.r: Added strategy rm-files, which calls
	the rm utility to remove a list of files.

	* spec/slib/src/stratego-lib.h (_ST_get_pid): see below
	
	* spec/slib/src/exec.c (ST_get_pid): Added primitive get_pid for
	obtaining the process identifier of the current process.

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: Use unique file name for writing parse
 	tree to, instead of the fixed file /tmp/aaabb. Thanks Danny van
 	Velzen and Eelco Dolstra for finding this bug.

2000-06-04    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/string.r: Changed definition of basename such
 	that it removes the part after the last . in the name instead of
 	after the first. Also defined a variant that takes a strategy for
 	testing the extension as parameter. [This caused a bug in
 	pack-stratego if a module like ./file.r was compiled as Danny van
 	Velzen found out.]
	
	* xmpl/prop/: Example specification with transformation of
 	propositional formulae.

	* doc/tutorial/slides/Makefile.am (doc_targets): Rules for
	making and installing TutorialSlides

	* share/tex/LaTeX.Make: Rules for producing pdf from latex.

	* www/publications.html: Headers in bold.

	* www/documentation.html: Added links to pdf documents.

	* doc/*: Added rules for making PDF versions of the documentation.
  	Note that the specials generated by gpic are not interpreted by
 	pdfelatex; therefore no pictures in PDF.

	* spec/: bootstrap + bootinstall
	
	* spec/lib/stratlib-test.r: Simple tests for "tvars". It turned
 	out that collect-kids did not work properly because of error in
 	explode-term. The second test shows the case were it went wrong.

	* spec/front/frontend.r: Commented out timings of sub-components of
	frontend.

	* spec/slib/spec/sunit.r: The test apply-and-show only applies a 
	strategy and does not test the result.

	* spec/slib/spec/Makefile.am (TESTS): Added reals-test

	* spec/slib/spec/reals-test.r: Changed tests to apply-and-show, because
	for some reason the comparison of real results does not work.

	* spec/slib/spec/io.r: Added import of exec, because "exit" is used
	in some strategies.

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Repaired bug in REAL congruence.

	* spec/rts/stratego.c (_MatchRealFC + _MatchReal): Implemented by 
	copying from _MatchInt

	* spec/rts/svm.h: Added MatchReal/FC

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Added definition of strategy
 	substitute, which renames the bound variables it passes through
 	while substituting.

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: Simplified definition of rename by 
	inlining and removing rename-body.

	* test/numbers/*: Testing of real numbers in rules and as congruence.

	* spec/slib/src/term.c (_mkterm): Added cases for real and integer 
	numbers.

	* spec/: bootstrap + bootinstall
	
	* spec/slib/spec/string.r: Added new as primitive.

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Removed new, kids and str_gt as keywords.

	* spec/: bootstrap + bootinstall

	* doc/tutorial/slides: Extended slides for lecture in Software
	Generation course.

	* configure.in: added xmpl/Makefile.am,
 	doc/tutorial/slides/Makefile.am

	* xmpl/Makefile.am: New directory xmpl/ for example specifications

2000-05-14    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/tables.r: table-putlist converts a list of pairs
 	to a table. (Contributed by Otto Bagge)

	* doc/tutorial/slides: Adapted slides for INRIA talk

	* doc/reference/: Reorganization of the reference manual.

	* spec/sdf/: Syntax definition of Stratego in SDF2.

2000-05-02    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/*/io.[cr]: new primitive _ST_append_file; opens a file
 	in append mode, _ST_close_file is now declared in stratego-lib.h,
 	so that code using it will compile, added append-file strategy and
 	documentation for it to io.r (by Otto)

	* spec/slib/spec/tables.r: table-list transforms a table into a list
	of key/value pairs. (by Otto)

2000-04-12    <visser@loempia.cs.uu.nl>

	* Added a lot of forgotten files to the repository.

2000-04-10    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* doc/library/body.ltx: Added list-filter

2000-03-29    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

2000-03-27    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* bootinstall

	* spec/slib/spec/*: operations -> constructors
	
	* configure.in: default for ATerm library is $prefix. Now also
	noted in the help string.

	* spec/slib/spec/conditonal.r+iteration.r supersede basic.r:
 	Sequential control operators are split into modules conditional.r,
 	definining operators like try and if, and iteration.r defining
 	operators like repeat.

2000-03-26    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* bootinstall

	* TODO: organized the list into categories

	* www/maillist/*.txt: Announcements of releases

	Description of the release 0.4.11 on news page.

	* spec/slib/src/io.c: parentheses

	* doc/tutorial/intro/overview.ltx: Changed my opinion on
	the suitability of Stratego for program analysis.

2000-03-25    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: -o option to indicate the target of
 	compilation. --ast option to indicate that abstract syntax tree
 	should be produced (interface to the parser).

	* spec/slib/spec/env-traversal.r: More rules for
	environment propagation through traversals.

2000-03-20    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	*  www/:  Vanity  operation on  the  appearance  of the web  page;
 	contents now in olive and without frame borders.

2000-03-18    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Removed dead code.

	* spec/slib/spec/free-variables.r: Removed dead code. Distinghuish
	two classes of free variable extraction.

	* spec/slib/spec/basic.r: New variants of repetition operators while,
	for, etc.

	* spec/*/*: operations -> constructors

	* spec/sc/: Improved option handling. Show usage messages with
 	help option. Show version information. Usage information similar
 	to gcc. Removed dead code.

	* spec/lib/stratlib.r: Adapted svars-arity to new free-vars
	strategy

	* spec/slib/env-traversal.r: Traversals that distribute or
	thread an environment along the way.

2000-03-15    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* test/control/*: Directory with tests for control structures,
	including test of thread operator.

	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Refactored the unification
	algorithm using the new term decomposition notation f#(xs).

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Renamed subs' to subs; the
	overloading is resolved by arity.

	* spec/slib/spec/basic.r: New loop strategies repeat-until and
	for.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/list-misc.r: copy strategy creates list with
	n copies of a term and a variant of foldr that applies a
	strategy to the elements of the list.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Refactored the collect strategies
	using the new f#(xs) syntax. Kids has disappeared.

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Added newlines to obsolete messages.

2000-03-14    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* spec/slib/spec/*.r: Declared constructors and changed keyword
	operations to constructors.

2000-03-13    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* spec/syn/stratego.[lex,grm] + spec/sig/sugar.r: Extension of the
 	syntax with sugar for exploded terms with the following
 	equivalences:

	  ?f#(xs) == ?(f, xs) <= explode-term
	  !f#(xs) == <mkterm> (f, xs)
	  s1#(s2) == explode-term; (s1, s2); mkterm

	* test/syntax/mkterm.r: Syntax + semantics check of syntax
	extension for exploded terms.
	
	* doc/tutorial/xmpl/disjnf.r: Import lib instead of io since io
 	depends also on exit + gives wrong example of typical usage. Added
 	regression test.

2000-03-11    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* src/slib/src/stratego-lib.c: Removed because obsolete.

	* spec/rts/svm.h: Reduced the sizes of all stacks considerably.
  	This makes a difference in the amount of static memory that is
 	allocated by generated transformation systems.

2000-03-09    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* Release 0.4.10

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Added a commandline option for passing the
	name of the main strategy to compile:
	    sc --main transform-it -i transform.r
	or
	    sc -m transform-it -i transform.r
	makes "transform-it" into the main strategy. If the option is
	not passed "main" is assumed to be the main strategy. 	

	Note that the main strategy needs to handle its own IO as usual,
	that is, it is should probably look like 
	    transform-it = stdio(transform)
	or
	    transform-it = iowrap(transform)
	
	* spec/slib/spec/exec.r: The strategy <transform-file(s, suf)>
 	(base, ext) reads in the term from file "base.ext", applies
 	strategy | to it and write the result to the concatenation of the
 	strings (base, <suf>()).
	
	* test/*/*.[r|am] : added new test cases

	* spec/slib/src/io.c : Closed filed after writing to or reading
 	from it. Failure to do so caused problems when reading in a file
 	that was written before or when reading many (different) files,
 	causing the to overflow the limit on open files (SunOS).

2000-03-07    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Separated expansion of overlays
	from desugaring of rules.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Used new style of option handling for
 	proto-sc in preparation of adding new option to specify main
 	strategy on the command line.

	* spec/front/frontend.r: Constructor checking + timing of
 	components.
	
	* spec/front/check-constructors.r: Added checking of
 	constructor declarations to the frontend. Currently only a warning
 	is generated and constructor declaration is not enforced. This
 	will change in the future. Note: only constructors that are
 	actually used in the specification need to be declared. Anonymous
 	constructors that are only traversed need not be declared.

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Introduced // comment. Introduced
 	alternative keyword "constructors" for "operations" in signatures,
 	because that fits the use better. Use of "operations" should be
 	phased out.
	
2000-03-03    <Eelco Visser <visser@cs.uu.nl>>

	* Release 0.4.9

	* check-dist.in: Shell script for testing the distribution created
 	by 'make dist'.

	* spec/slib/list-set.r: Repaired error in definition of union and
 	diff to migrating from Cons/Nil syntax to [|] syntax; the common
 	mistake to forget to replace the comma by a |.

2000-03-01    <visser@cs.uu.nl> 

	* spec/lib/stratlib.r: New renaming strategies

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r+free-variables.r: Split the
 	parameterization of renaming into two: paste defines how new
 	variables should be pasted back into the binding construct,
 	boundin declares which arms of the construct are binding, which
 	are not binding and which don't matter. By this separation of
	concerns free variable extraction has been redefined reusing
	the boundin notion.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/unification.r: Layout + new syntax.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/pack-graph.r: Using new ? <= syntax.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/io.r: New version of debug; debug(msg) prefixes
	the printed term with msg (should be a building strategy).
	
	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Redefined collect, now parameterized
 	with a strategy for stopping recursion.

	* spec/slib/spec/simple-traversal.r: New traversals that are
 	parameterized with a stop operator that can be used to cut of
 	recursion. More documentation.
	
	* www/sud.html: Announcement of the first Stratego Users Day.

2000-02-28    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/*/Makifile.am: Repaired bootinstall targets.

	* src+spec/slib/spec/: Added sglr.r and gpp.r to Makefiles.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r + spec/syn/pack-stratego.r:
 	Parameterized pack-modules with a strategy for determining the
 	target of the generated dependency file.

2000-02-27    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/front/spec-to-sdefs.r: Introduced scope for implicitly
	declared variables in strategy definitions.
	Removed obsolete code for adding definitions of primitives. 

	* spec/front/use-def.r: Relaxed the requirement for declarations
 	of variables; variables that are not explicitly declared in a
 	strategy definition are implicitly declared.

	* test/static/: Testing of implictly declared variables in
	strategy definitions.

	* spec/slib/spec/gpp.r + sglr.r: As yet empty files to contain
 	interfaces to the pretty-printing and parsing tools.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Improved the definition of
	collect such that it does not have to concatenate empty
	lists when nothing is found in a subtree. It should still
	be determined whether this is actually more efficient.

	* spec/slib/src/exec.c: Improved error messages given by
	<call> on failure.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Allow file extension for root module on
	commandline by transforming file to basename.

	* spec/*/Makefile.am: Added executables to CLEANFILES variables
 	because bin_SCRIPTS elements are not automatically thrown away.

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: iowrap prints "program (time secs)"
	instead of "rewriting succeeded (time secs)".

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-modules.r: General user-interface for
	packing modules reachable from root module. Includes creation
	of a dependency file for inclusion in makefiles.

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: Refactored the definiton of module
 	packing in order to extract a language independent formulation of
 	the algorithm.

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Introduced new syntax for 'assignments';
	the strategy expression ?t <= s is equivalent to s; ?t and to
	s => t. The advantage of this new syntax is that it is clearer
	than with the s => t syntax what the target of the assignment is.
	If s is a large expression the t can be difficult to spot.

2000-02-26    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* doc/library/body.ltx: Changed the order of the modules in
	the library to get better clustering.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack-graph.r: The strategy previously called
 	'worklist' has been renamed to 'graph-nodes'. It is a generic
 	algorithm for mapping a graph to a collection of nodes reachable
 	from a given root node. The algorithm is parameterized with the
 	following notions: 'get-node' maps a node name and a graph to the
 	node itself, 'out-edges' maps a node to the names of its out
 	edges, 'add-node' that adds a name and its corresponding node to a
 	collection of nodes. It can be used to pack a collection of
 	modules into a single file.

	* spec/slib/spec/string.r: Added 'basename' strategy that
	removes the extension from a filename (also succeeds if
	no extension available).

	* spec/*/*.c: Removed generated C code from repository.

	* share/Stratego.Make: Makerules for compiling Stratego
	specifications.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Integrated pack-stratego

	* spec/syn/parse-mod.c: Removed path handling inherited from
 	parse-stratego that made it impossible to parse a file at an
 	absolute path.

2000-02-25    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: The packing algorithm works. Next step
 	is integration into proto-sc.

2000-02-24    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* doc/compiler/intro/xmpl/*.r: Files contained GPL copyright
 	notices which were cluttering up the paper.

	* share/bib/other.bib + pp.bib: bibliographies for pretty-printing
 	and other things with references that are used in the
 	documentation. This is not intended to be a complete bibliography
 	about anything.

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Added -f option to removal of intermediate
 	files such that no error message is displayed for non-existing
 	files.

2000-02-23    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* test/*: Added several regression tests

	* spec/syn/pack-stratego.r: Instantiation of the module packing
 	algorithm for Stratego.

	* spec/slib/src+spec/io.[cr]: Added file-exists primitive
 	strategy.

	* spec/slib/spec/pack.r + test/pack/*: A generic framework for
 	packing and unpacking modules. Parameterized by the parser, the
 	shape of imports and modules and the way to construct the
 	result. Based on a worklist approach that repeatedly transforms a
 	configurations until done.
	
	* spec/syn/stratego.grm + test/syntax/*: The imports, sorts and
 	operations sections of a specification can now be empty. This
 	makes it easier to generate Stratego specifications.

	* src/*/Makifile.am: Reinstalling Stratego gave some problems
 	because the installed include files are read before the local
 	include files. This is problematic when aterm and stratego
 	installation directories coincide. One solution is to uninstall
 	the stratego distribution before remaking. I have also changed the
 	order of the includes in the makefiles to prevent this problem in
 	the future.
	
2000-02-21    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.8
	
	* test/lists + tests/options: Added files missing in distribution

	* src/slib/spec/: bootinstalled

	* doc/Makefile.am: Added rules for making documentation.

2000-02-20    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/sc/proto-sc.r: Repaired option handling by the compiler
 	(Thanks Merijn) and extended the usage information printed when
 	something is wrong or when requested.

2000-02-19    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Removed '|' from characters that can
	start a lowercase identifier because of conflict with new
	syntax for lists. (What was it there for in the first place?)

	* spec/slib/spec/*.r: Randomly applied the new syntax for lists,
	replacing Cons and Nil by [|] notation.

	* spec/slib/spec/abox.r: Split into abox.r and abox-ext.r. The
 	former defines the interface to Box, the latter defines syntactic
 	abstractions and strategies for constructing boxes. On request
 	from Otto provided rudimentary documentation to the abox
 	interface.

	* cvs commit (Sat Feb 19 13:10:31 GMT 2000)

	* bootstrap + bootinstall
	
	* src/slib/spec/: Added forgotten files to the repository.

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm Extending list syntax to allow for
 	specification of tail in Prolog style, i.e.,
	[x, y | z], where x and y are the first two elements and z is the
 	tail. This is translated to Cons/Nil notation. [x, y | z] is
 	equivalent to Cons(x, Cons(y, z)).

	* spec/rts/aterm-extension.[ch]: Changed list_to_cons_* and
 	list_to_cong* functions to deal with new list syntax; this
 	entailed parameterizing the functions with a tail argument.
	
2000-02-16    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/exec.r + io.r: Moved definition of exit from
	io to exec.

	* share/emacs/stratego.el: Commented out the tab-indent stuff
	because it doesn't consider the context correctly.

	* bootstrap + bootinstall

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Changed the lexical syntax of comments
	(can now contain *s) and strings (quotes in strings are handled
	properly). (Thanks Merijn)

2000-02-14    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Completed change

2000-02-11    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/options.r: Started to change the definition of
 	iowrap/1 using the option parser. Not yet completed, but the old
 	definition is still functional.

	* spec/slib/spec/parse-options.r: Generic parser for lists of
 	options of the form ["-i", "file", "-silent", "-o", "outfile"] to
 	terms of the form [Input("file"), Silent(), Output("outfile")].

	* spec/slib/*/exec.[rc]: Added call-noisy/0, which has the
 	function of the original call/0 (calling an external process) and
 	replaced call/0 by a silent version, which does not print out the
 	call.

2000-02-10    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* www/maillist/stratego: The list

	* doc/tutorial/xmpl/Makefile.am: Added the missing files to the
 	distribution target. (Thanks Karina)

	* spec/syn/stratego.lx: Changed lexerror to print newlines after
 	an error message. (Thanks Merijn)

2000-02-08    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* src/slib/spec/Makefile.am: Added memo.r to the installation
 	list.

	* www/configurations.html: List of working and problematic
 	configurations for installation

2000-02-07    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.7

	* Completed Makefiles with respect to distribution

2000-02-06    <visser@cs.uu.nl>
	
	* doc/library: added memo module

	* Added install files: mkinstalldirs, missing, and install-sh
	
	* bootstrapped + bootinstall

	* spec/syn/stratego.grm: Changed abstract syntax of call to
 	(default) traversal in a context rule to Call(SVar("..."), [])
 	such that needed def analysis does include these traversals.

	* spec/front/needed-defs.r: Overloading of strategy operators is
 	allowed for operators of different arity. This required changing
	the needed definitions computation and the inlining strategy.
	
	* spec/lib/StratLibTest.r: Added unit testing for elements of the
 	Stratego compiler library.

	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: Refactored the definition of free
 	variables extraction; use of variables is replaced by applications
 	of split; variables containing variables are now supported; this
 	is useful if a variable from a call is extracted together with
 	some information from its arguments. A new version
 	vars-eq(vars,bnd,eq) supports an equality predicate to decide
 	equality of bound variables.

	* share/emacs/stratego.el: Adapted indentation definitions to my
 	taste (only 2 from left margin instead of 4), but this creates a
 	problem for operator declarations, which should be indented more.
  	Can a distinction between rules and operator declarations be made?
	
	* spec/slib/spec/simple-traversal.r: breadthfirst strategy a la
 	Muchnik; first process all children, then recursively process all
 	subtrees. This is only semi breadth-first.

2000-02-01    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/memo.r: Memo operator based on table constructs

	* spec/slib/src: Removed MatchPair from io.c, included of tables.h
	in stratego-lib.h
	
2000-01-28    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* share/emacs/stratego.el: emacs mode for stratego contributed by
 	Otto Bagge.

2000-01-27    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Directory test/ is intentended for the collection of regression
 	tests. The first test is a simple shift-reduce parser in
 	test/parser.

2000-01-24    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Changed documentation links back to .gz because of quota on www
 	server.

2000-01-20    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.6

	* Added a copy permission to the documentation.
	
	* bootstrap + bootinstall
	
	* spec/slib/src/term.c: the primitive <kids> is obsolete, but
 	still defined. It prints a warning about obsolesence. It is no
 	longer used in the compiler and will be removed in a couple of
 	releases.
	
	* spec/slib/src/term.c: new primitive <address> turns a term into
 	its address.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/share.r: introduction of explicit sharing by
 	turning term into its underlying graph and then inlining those
 	edges that occur only once or have to be inlined anyway. (Inspired
 	by a question from Oege de Moor)

2000-01-19    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/bin-tree[-set].r: binary trees; one application
 	is the representation of sets

	* spec/slib/src/term.c: _address_lt compares the addresses of two
 	terms; spans a unique ordering on terms that can be used for
 	sorting

	- How does this behave under rehashing?
	
2000-01-15    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Added GPL copyright notice to all files

2000-01-12    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/share.r: a first attempt at solving Oege's
 	explicit sharing introduction problem

2000-01-05    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Updated NEWS file

	* Release 0.4.5
	
	* bootstrap + bootinstall
	
	* spec/slib/spec/ + spec/: replaced renaming strategy rename by
 	new version with slightly different parameters, which make it
 	possible to define a shape context for the name of the variable to
 	be renamed.

	* bootstrap + bootinstall

	* spec/slib/: Added primitive print-stack that prints the top n
 	elements of the stack if applied as <print-stack> n or the entire
 	stack if applied to a non-integer term.
	
	* spec/slib/src: Split prim.c into separate modules corresponding
	to the declaration of primitives in specification modules.

	* doc/tutorial: Added illustration of application of single
 	transformation rule. Updated examples of error messages.

	* www/: updated the information about the distribution

1999-12-22    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: simplified definition of rename
	
	* spec/slib/spec/substitution.r: refactored free variable
 	collection using collect-kids, avoiding stacked bindings.

	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: Repaired collect-split; strings are
 	treated in the wrong way by mkterm. Redefined collect in terms of
 	collect-kids, which is defined in terms of explode-term.

	* Introduced Kids as an alternative to kids; it produces a *list*
	of arguments (as opposed to a tuple).
	
	* spec/slib/spec/abox.r: added some more useful abstractions
	
	* bootstrapped and bootinstalled
	
1999-12-21    <visser@cs.uu.nl>
	
	* spec/syn + front/: added syntax and desugaring for `lambda
 	rules' of the form \F(x, G(y)) -> H(x, y)\. Such rules declare a
 	new scope for the variables in the lhs of the rule but not for the
 	variables in the rhs and condition of the rule that do not appear
 	in the lhs.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/rename.r: new version of rename that can deal
 	better with typed variables without requiring tagging of the name
 	only.
	
	* spec/slib/spec/list-set.r: new strategy collect-split(f, g)
	reduces terms with f and extracts information with g resulting
	in a pair (t, xs) of a reduced term and the list of extracted
	subterms.
	
	* doc/tutorial/xmpl/traversals.r: repaired an eternal typo in
	the traversals example

1999-12-15    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.4b
	
	* www/: anounced the new release and announced the mailing-list
	stratego@cs.uu.nl

	* bootstrapped and bootinstalled

	* spec/*/*.r.dep: removed, don't belong in repository
	
	* spec/*/Makefile.am: removed builtsources definitions to prevent
	double compilation of the generated C files

1999-12-14    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* spec/slib/src/stratego-lib.c: Incorporated fix of
 	_implode_string by Merijn de Jonge (thanks). Can now deal with any
 	size strings.
	
	* spec/syn/parse-stratego.c: Changed "module.comp" target in
 	generated module.r.dep file to a "module" target, since .comp is
 	no longer generated by sc.

1999-12-07    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* doc/tutorial: present rules for prop. formulae in separate
	section

1999-12-05    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Added README.in (parameterized with version number) now with 
	updated installation information
	* Changed titlepages style file for documentation; now: titlepage,
	copyright page and summary page. So that table of contents can 
	start at even page.
	* Removed Makefiles, Makefile.ins and .depends from CVS repository
	* Installed new documents at the web site. Added link to old tutorial.

1999-12-04    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* doc/tutorial:
	* Finished the "Stratego by Example" section, which gives an overview
	of developing Stratego Specifications.
	* Extended the example of simplification of propositional formulae
	with more laws and a module with truth rules. In addition the 
	constructors Impl, Eq, False, True have been added. Allowing for
	different normal forms (e.g., implicative normal form that only
	uses implication and False).
	* Added a debugging section (not yet finished)
	* Improved the installation instructions (thanks Andrew)
	* Updated the description of the structure of the distribution.
	* New chapters on primitives and advanced features.
	* Chapter "Concrete Syntax" renamed to "Connecting to Outside
	Components" with sections on parsers and pretty-printers.

1999-12-02    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Working on The Tutorial
	* Revised and finished the introduction and installation chapters
	* Started with the revision of the "Stratego by Example" chapter.
	Not yet finished.

	* proto-sc no longer produces .comp files but uses the basename
	of the main module as name of the executable.
	* Added (description of) new release to the web page

1999-12-01    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Release 0.4.4a 
	
	* The attempt to treat aterm built-in lists as first-class
 	citizens has gone horribly wrong somewhere. I'm now reverting to
 	the previous working version and committing only those changes
 	(e.g., in the documentation) that do work. Then first release 0.5a
 	without built-in lists and then another attempt.

	* Added some files from the attempt that are harmless and needed
	in the future.

	* Number of new ideas for improvements/extensions in TODO
	* Creating version 0.4.4a for the time being
	* Creating sc from sc.in during configuration

	* All documents use standard titlepage
	* Added rts sources to compiler document
	
	
1999-11-15    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Titlepages for library and compiler documentation

	* Cons/Nil also applies to ATerm lists:
	  - added rule to automaton generation (ConsHead(), ConsTail())
	  - compilation of Cons, Nil, and ConsHead, ConsTail in compiler.r
	  -> only for matching; building and congruence still needs to be
	     done
	  -> also: rts needs to be extended

1999-11-12    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Brought the documentation sources in doc/ up to date
	* Got dist and distcheck to work
	* Created a fresh CVS repository for the new setup of the 
	implementation
	* Checked that the repository is complete and that it can
	make, bootstrap and distribute.
	* Added previous release dates to this log
	* The directory tree:
	- doc/
	  - doc/compiler/
	  - doc/library/
	  - doc/reference/
	  - doc/tutorial/
	- include/          : C include files
	- lib/              : executable libraries
	- share/

	- spec/             : Stratego sources of compiler
	- src/              : generated C sources of compiler
	- www/

1999-11-11    <visser@cs.uu.nl>

	* Got making, bootstrapping and bootinstallation to work with
 	autoconf/make. Directory src/ containts the bootstrapped source,
 	i.e., the C code generated from specifications (either Stratego,
 	LEX/YACC, or whatever). Directory spec/ contains the entire
 	specification of the compiler. This directory should be used to
 	develop a new version. After bootstrapping (with make target
 	bootstrap in spec/), the new version can be installed in the
	src tree by means of bootinstall.

	* Started using emacs supported ChangeLog instead of hand-made
 	CHANGES
	
Mon Nov  8 15:41:56 GMT 1999

 * Starting to bring the stratego package under autoconf
 * Added intermediate file removal to sc
 * Put header files for the run-time system in a subdirectory
   called stratego. The stratego.h header file includes these
   files. To prevent file-name collisions when installing.
 * Created a logo for Stratego that looks vaguely like this:

	/|\
       / | \
      /  |  \
     /   |   \
   \/   \ /   \/
   /\   / \   /\
  /  \ /   \ /  \
  ---------------

  see lib/tex/logo

Fri Nov  5 11:40:33 GMT 1999

 * Separated implementation of primitives from the run-time system.
   Primitives are now defined in the library. This makes the run-time
   system more stable and the library easier to extend.
 * New target docinstall to make all documentation and install PostScript
   files in doc/; There are now four documents: The Stratego Tutorial, 
   Reference Manual, Library and Compiler.

Thu Nov  4 19:11:35 GMT 1999

 * New setup of the Stratego webpage

Tue Nov  2 18:39:47 GMT 1999

 * New setup of the Stratego implementation completed
 * Makefile for entire implementation
   with bootstrap target 
 * Changes in interface to sc:
   - -i mod instead of just mod
   - -IL "-Ldir" to pass include directories to gcc
   - -CL "-Ldir -llib" to pass libraries to gcc
 * Documentation in doc/

Mon Nov  1 14:44:07 GMT 1999

 * New setup of the Stratego implementation

Mon Nov  1 14:27:36 GMT 1999

 * Treatment of overlays as pseudo signature declarations.
 * Simplified transformation of variables to constants (when they are)
 * Added -CC (compile C code only) and -h, -?, --help flags to sc
 * sc: Any number of -I options can now be specified
 * Using new option processing mode: collect options of a kind

Sat Oct 23 18:55:48 BST 1999

 * Added table operations (interface to ATerm tables) to the primitives
 * <explode-term> f(t1,...,tn) -> ("f", [t1,...,tn])
 * terms.c: list_to_consnil_shallow
 * Added identifier without parentheses as possible overlay in trs.grm

Sun Oct  3 20:07:47 BST 1999

	 * RELEASE 0.4.3a
	
 * Added stdio operator to lib/stratego/io.r
 * Repaired int-to-string; was broken after extension of div to yield
   real values
 * Some useful abbreviations in lib/stratego/text.r

Sep 7, 1999

	* RELEASE 0.4.2a
	
Mon Aug 30 11:23:09 BST 1999

 * Added real numbers as primitive datatype.
 * Primitives for arithmetic have been extended (overloaded) to
   real numbers. New primitive int maps a real to an integer.
 * strategy averages in lib/stratego/int-list.r computes the averages
   of the columns of a list of list of numbers.
 * string-to-num extends string-to-int by recognizing real numbers of
   the form [0-9]+[\.][0-9]+.
 
Mon Aug 23 16:18:43 BST 1999

 * Added module int-list (library) for common operation on lists of 
   integers (e.g., sum, average).
 * Applying explode-string to a non-string no longer leads to a warning.
 * Added -pp option to invoke printing of pretty-printed text produced
   by the box expression in lib/stratego/text.r. The option assumes that
   the strategy produces text boxes in normal form.
 * Inclusion of the library module text.r in io.r had several consequences
   for naming in compiler modules; name-space is becoming full; is it
   time for a hiding mechanism?
 * Renamed the "sort" strategies in list-sort to "sort-list" to prevent
   confusion.
 * Corrected path to bin in INSTALL

Sun Aug 22 23:50:47 BST 1999

 * Added the "printascii" primitive in prim.[ch] that prints the integers
   in a list as ascii characters.

Fri Aug 20 17:43:26 BST 1999

 * Adapted implode-asfix to deal with literals injected into alternatives
   (should be removed by rm-layout)

Tue Aug 17 10:08:00 BST 1999

 * Improved utils/implode-asfix.r so that it can deal with ambiguities
   in parse trees. This makes it possible to inspect ambiguities at the
   abstract syntax level.

Mon Aug 16 00:06:47 BST 1999

 * It is no longer a fatal error to try to explode a non-string term;
   it is just a failure.
 * Bootstrapping only uses 4 phases now (this is sufficient, isn't it?)

Aug 12 1999

	* RELEASE 0.4.1a
	
Fri Jul 30 16:22:13 BST 1999

 * Added primitives for opening files. Print looks up the file descriptor
   for a file in a table.

Thu Jul 29 15:41:05 BST 1999

 * Introduced prim keyword in language that can be used to introduce
   primitive strategy operators.

   A prim("f") expression is translated to a call to the C function f.

 * Moved the definitions of primitive operators from the compiler 
   to the library. In this way it becomes much easier to add new
   primitive operators. Instead of extending the language and
   bootstrapping, just add a definition

      f = prim("implementation_of_f")

   in an appropriate module and provide the implementation of f in
   C file that is linked with the strategy library.

   see lib/stratego: integers.r string.r

 * Added primitives for file IO in lib/stratego/io.r. This provides
   a definition for iowrap(s) that does all the handling of options
   that was previously done by the default main procedure. The new
   main procedure provided in strategy-main.c only builds a term
   consisting of a list of the command-line arguments. These are
   then unpacked and interpreted by the wrapper. In this manner
   it becomes much easier to make custom command-line option handling
   and file IO.

 * Added primitive "call" for execution of external processes. See
   lib/stratego/exec.r

 * Wrote sc.r; a specification of the Stratego compiler that glues
   together the components of the compiler.

Thu Jul  1 04:55:42 BST 1999

 - Note: rules for Choice(s, id) -> s are wrong!
 * Repaired error in needed-defs; MissingDef should be applied to result
   of previous transformations.
 * Binary input and output for generated transformers
 * Changed the implementation of BuildVar[d] in strategy.h to fail in case
   of an unbound variable instead of exiting.


Jun 30, 1999

	* RELEASE 0.3a
	
Wed Jun 16 10:26:33 BST 1999

 * Added primitives is-int and is-string for testing whether a term
   is an integer or a string constant.
 * Forgot a case in merging of matching automata

Wed Jun  9 11:44:23 GMT 1999

 * New traversal operator: thread(s) with semantics

      Pair(t1, e1) - s -> Pair(t1',e2) ... Pair(tn, en) - s -> Pair(tn',e')
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Pair(f(t1,...,tn), e1) --- thread(s) ---> Pair(f(t1',...,tn'), e')

   used to thread an environment through a traversal. 

 * It is used in the definition of MakeLinear (automaton.r)

 *  New matching automaton generator (automaton.r). Patterns in a choice
    of strategies guarded by a match are first translated to a matching
    automaton that defines a pre-order traversal of a tree to match the
    pattern. The automaton uses the actions Down and Up to traverse the 
    tree. The automata for a choice are then merged. This is very similar
    in principle to the old way of doing it, but more elegant. New features:
 
    - special matching instructions (not strictly necessary, but was
      useful for getting insight
    - continuation passing style of these instructions (instead of using
      Seq)
    - insight: if one automaton wants to do an Up and another a Down (or
      MatchFun, ...) then the first should also do a Down step followed
      by an Up step; the first automaton does not want to inspect the
      subtree, but there is no harm in following the second automaton in
      actually doing it.

Mon May 31 12:17:34 CEST 1999

 * Implemented the overlay mechanism. Affects: 
   - syntax
   - normalization
   - use-def
   - specs-to-sdef
 * Implemented static link mechanism to correctly handle static
   scopes under recursion. There is an extra stack that keeps track
   of activation records and static links to enclosing activation
   records. New operations are Epushd(i, o), Epopd(i, o) and BuildVard(x)
   and MatchVard(x). The rcs variable in the compiler rules are used
   to keep track of the static nesting level.
 * Documented modules normalize-spec, use-def
 * New module stratego has complete abstract syntax of the language

Tue Mar  9 13:04:08 CET 1999

 * Support for higher-order strategy arguments. Strategy operators can
   be passed to strategy operators. Partial applications are not
   supported.
 * Enhanced handling of sequences in parse trees, these are mapped
   to tuples (utils/implode-asfix)

Tue Mar  2 09:49:52 CET 1999

 * Created ./configure script in boot/ to configure the Makefile and sc
   script

	* RELEASE 0.2a

Mon Mar  1 09:38:58 CET 1999

 * boot/sc : a script for compiling Stratego specifications
 * Moved transformation of variables that are unary constructors to
   normalize-spec.r. Now use-def analysis works correctly. 
 * Added translation to error messages with explanations.
 * Documentation of library to lib/stratego

Fri Feb 26 17:19:55 CET 1999

 * design/use-def.r : use-def analysis for term variables in rules
   and strategies. Purpose is to detect variables that are used in
   build constructs without a previous match. 
 - The analysis works,
   but problem are unary constructors in terms that are parsed as
   variables. Move the transformation of these variables to constructors
   to the normalize-spec phase.

Fri Feb 26 13:03:31 CET 1999

 * Added a normalization phase to the frontend that gathers constructor
   declarations, rule and strategy definitions. Result: triple of
   constructors, rules and strategies.

Fri Feb 26 11:15:25 CET 1999

 * Better error reporting in case of unbound variables and recursion
   stack overflow. Reduced the undefined strategy operator situation
   to an error message.
 * Introduced a FAIL operator in the library that does not get simplified
   away.
 * On final failure (no choice points left) a transformer returns the 
   top of the stack. This term is printed (currently to the designated
   output file, but maybe a special error target should be provided).
   The transformer then exits with error code 1. This in order to
   make components that indicate that something went wrong, but still
   want to report what it was.
 * Added vars.r to repository

Wed Feb 24 17:36:36 CET 1999

 * Improvement in handling of injections in implode-asfix

Mon Feb 15 17:47:52 CET 1999

 * Implemented explode-string primitive

	
 * Setup for introduction; needs simple first example
 * Setup for examples chapter
 * All examples/modules are read using input and should be in litstyle
	
Thu Feb 11 12:40:38 CET 1999

 * new bootstrap
 * extended makefiles to create distribution directory

Tue Feb  9 15:16:38 CET 1999

 * implode-asfix in utils/ works: translates trees over wflang.sdf to
   terms complying to the signature of wflang.r.
 * Documentation in utils/doc
 * The recursive pattern in xmpl/fusion/wflang-check.r checks the output
   of this conversion 

 - Problems: 
   - overloading of strategy operators: sort in list-sort and sort congruence
     in asfix.r, there is no way to resolve this except actually renaming
     of the operators (not the congruence).
   - there seem to be bugs in the matching tree computation; see TODO

Tue Feb  9 10:55:57 CET 1999

 * Added a utils/ directory for general utitilities written in Stratego.
 * Almost complete initial version of a tool to convert SDF2 parse trees
   to corresponding abstract syntax trees.
 * Added an includes mechanism to the parser such that an include
   directory containing library modules can be specified using the
   commandline option -include <dir>
 * Changed syntax to ignore case in term constructors. This means that
   lowercase and uppercase identifiers can be used as constructors and
   variables. Unary constructors are distinghuised from variables by looking
   at the signature declarations. This means that a constructor not declared
   in the signature will be treated as a variable.
 - Because of this several missing declarations were added.
 * vars.r: all variables from a specification (special case of a general
   collection strategy: make this)
 * Moved library files in design to design/lib

Thu Dec 31 14:48:38 CET 1998

 * Command line option handling: see rts/option.[hc]. Uniform for
   all tools. Options handled now are:
           tool [-silent] [-i file] [-o file] [-stats] [-help|-h]
 * Bug in rts/trs.lx: whitespace between imports was not ignored

Thu Dec 24 15:09:39 CET 1998

 * Adapted inlining approach to do less inlining, i.e., only operators
   with arguments and nullary operators corresponding to rules are inlined.
   As a consequence the frontend no longer produces a single strategy
   expression, but a list of sdefs.
 * Code generation for list of SDefs
 * Repaired bug in code produced for Fail
 * Updated todo list.

 - There is a bug in MakeLinear

Mon Nov  9 11:17:53 PST 1998

 * Found bug in the transformation that computes the matching 
   automaton; due to insufficient renormalization of branches,
   variable cases would be skipped in the ChoiceMerge' phase.
   Repaired by being more careful about reconstruction; mainly
   maintain right-associativity of sequences.

   Went from rules with contexts to rules with explicit traversals
   in conditions; control over order of traversals is important.

 * Discovered while developing numeric expression example. See
   xmpl/numexp

 * collect strategy creates list of all outermost redexes of a term
   for some strategy

Tue Nov  3 11:10:47 PST 1998

 * Special implementation for fetch of a matching strategy. Translates
   tail recursion into a loop. Does not use recursion stack to keep
   track where it is. Once a matching element is found it jumps to
   the end of the loop and is done.

 * Special implementation for oncetd of a matching only (i.e., no
   building) strategy. The specialization does not rebuild the term
   after inspecting it, since a strategy without builds cannot change
   the subject term. This should be generalized to arbitrary traversals
   without builds; but this requires some analysis to determine that
   the call to one, some or build (often to a recursion variable) does
   not involve builds.

 * Used pseudo-innermost3 in matching-tree. This strategy normalizes
   reducts three levels deep, whereas innermost' re-normalizes the
   reduct completely doing a lot of unnecessary work. Three levels deep
   is enough for most rules; this fails if there is a rule with right-hand
   side deeper than threel levels that creates new redices.

 * Added syntax and desugaring for semi-rules. A rule
   L :: s1 --> s2 where s3 abbreviates the strategy definition
   L = {x1,...,xn: s1; where(s3); s2}. This is useful for rules
   that use overlays instead of real patterns.

 * Created new modules design/specialized.r for the specification of
   exceptions to the normal straightforward translations.

 * Used overlays for the Repeat(s1, s2) pattern in design/specialized.r

Tue Oct 27 09:40:52 PST 1998

 * New syntax: ?t for match(t), !t for build(t)
 * Introduced term annotation operators @!(l, t) for add annotation with
   label l and term t and @?(l, t) for match annotation with label
   l against pattern t. Does work for small examples, but application
   in innermost leads to garbage collection problems (annotations that
   get collected while still referenced). The abstract syntax of these
   operations is: AnnBuild, AnnGet, AnnRemove
 * Use of innermost' instead of innermost in matching-tree leads to
   reduction of 50%.
 * Repaired bug in rts/terms.c; wrong recursive call in list_cong_aux
 * Removed some dead comments from grammar
 * Documentation of the compiler now in design/doc/

Fri Oct 23 12:32:52 PDT 1998

 * Renaming of some of the traversals in design/lib.r
 * Experimenting with traversals in matching-tree to find out where the
   complexity is. (Probably in the application of ChoiceMerge to merge
   branches with the same prefix.)
 * Added some new simplification rules for idempotent application of
   Where, Not and Test.

Wed Oct 21 14:56:40 PDT 1998

 * Match trees are now working. It is instructive to study the performance
   of the components with and without this feature. The optimizer and backend
   do 2 to 3 times better, while the frontend is not affected at all. (The
   addition of extra asserts may have added a small performance penalty.)
   This becomes also clear by looking at the mt (for matching-tree) column:
   it spends only 0.76 in the frontend, but 10.19 in the optimizer and 42.19 
   in the backend.

   Extend match trees technique to left choices, choices of congruences and
   combinations of these.

Wed Oct 21 14:01:14 PDT 1998

 * Implemented matching trees (also known as discrimination nets).
   See design/matching-tree.r. This is an extra component in the
   compiler pipeline, which is now formed by:

   frontend | optimizer | matching-tree | optimizer | backend | postprocess

   The matching tree transformation improves on the previous Case
   transformation. The idea of the latter was the following

    Choice(Seq(MatchFun(f), s1), 
    Choice(Seq(MatchFun(f), s2),
           Seq(MatchFun(g), s3))) ->
   
    Case([(f, Choice(s1, s2)), (g, s3)])

   that is, small matching prefixes are committing, i.e., once you
   have seen an f you know you don't have to backtrack to try to
   match it as a g.

   The match tree transformation extends this to the arguments of
   operators.

 * This version does not yet use the discrimination net transformation.
   But does use the new implementation of Matching. (With Arg(x))
   With this feature stable, I can make another attempt at bootstrapping
   the discrimination net addition.

 * Don't mix up your units! I replaced branches of a choice by an
   Id instead of fail while merging some branches, i.e.,

	Choice(a, b) -> Choice(F(a, b), Id)

   This is of course wrong, because this means the choice can now always
   succeed. This took me a while and some peering in the generated abstract
   machine code to realise. It is time for an automatic checker of the 
   correctness of the rewrite rules;-)

 * There were some bugs(?) in the abstract machine instructions. Put in
   more asserts to detect violations. Strange that these problems didn't
   show up before. For instance, MatchFun didn't distinghuish between strings
   and constructors. Redefined the kids() instruction
   by means of other instructions instead of by means of a recursive
   C function. For some reason the old implementation triggered a problem
   in the garbage collector.

 * Numbered some of the simplification rules. It is instructive to see
   in the profile counts which rules are actually used. Very few.

 * Wrote term pretty-printer that deals with tuples. Tuples are internally
   represented as TCons/TNil lists, but are printed as ( , ..., ).


Fri Oct 16 16:43:26 PDT 1998

 * Restricted the application of CongBuild to cases where the
   branches of the build are only dependend on variables matched
   in the same branch.

   CongBuild did not work because the variables in MatchVar where
   not recognisable as such. Solution: keep Var(x) tags around the
   variable name. (Also necessary to keep renaming to work.)
   Future: don't translate Match(Var(x)) -> MatchVar(Var(x)).

   In order to make the CongBuild rule applicable at all it was
   necessary to perform a fusion loop before the other simplifications
   that lift MatchFuns out of scopes for the purpose of case merging.

   The CongBuild rule does work, but does not seem to be very effective.
   There are only a few places where it can be applied. 

   This is a special case of traversal fusion. If two similar
   traversals are applied sequentially, they can be merged into a
   single traversal. (Basically the map fusion of functional
   programming generalised to traverals of arbitray datastructures.)
   However, this kind of fusion becomes problematic in the presence
   of side-effects (Match). (Consider fusion for strategies without
   free variables.)

 * Implementation of abstract machine instructions as procedures does
   not seem to impede the speed of generated components.

Thu Oct 15 16:30:53 PDT 1998

 * Restarted work on warm fusion specification.

 * Reached the limit of capabilities of gcc with current #define approach.
   Reimplemented abstract machine instructions as procedures instead
   of as #defines. Seems to speed up C compilation time considerably.

   Problem to be solved: jumping to (failure) continuations from within
   an instruction. Global jumping seems to mess up the stack. Solution
   is to have such instructions return the address to jump to or NULL.
   A wrapper takes care of the jump.

   (Discovery: linked libraries should be specified in reverse order,
   i.e., library used by other libraries last.;-)

 * Shorter rule for definition of contextual rules.

 * Match-Build fusion: A match followed (with Seq) by a build
   can be fused. Or, a congruence followed by a build can
   be fused. Also the other way around. But Match-Build is more
   common. This merges building up part of the original term in
   the right-hand side of a rule with the matching of the left-hand
   side.

 * App(s, t) is no longer eliminated by the desugaring phase, but
   handled directly by the backend. This creates more opportunities
   for Match-Build fusion. 

 ! Well, actually Match-Build fusion and keeping App turns out to
   be more complicated. With Match-Build fusion the problem is that
   before building the new term it is necessary to know all variables
   from the match. For instance, consider

      match(((x, y), (xs, ys))); build(Cons(x, xs), Cons(y, ys))

   we cannot fuse these expressions into 

      (match((x, y));   build(Cons(x, xs)), 
       match((xs, ys)); build(Cons(y, ys)))

   because xs will not be known at the time of building Cons(x, xs).

   But the basic idea is still attractive: reuse the structure that
   is already on the stack. 

   In this version the fusion transformations are disabled.

 * Tail recursion elimination: pattern repeat(s) (rec x((s; x) <+ s'))
   can be treated specially. Created specialized compilation
   rules in compiler.r to handle such exceptions. These are tried
   before other rules of the compiler. 

   (This optimization does not seem to produce a significant speed-up.
   Nonetheless it has the benefit that it uses a constant depth term-
   and choice stack as opposed to a stack that gets as deep as the
   number of repetitions.)

 * Case merging: Generalized the rules for transforming choices to
   case statements such that a choice of cases is merged.

 * Added rule counters for each rule. The desugaring phase adds an
   invocation of the primitive CountRule(f) with f the label of
   the rule in sequential composition *after* the rule has completely
   succeeded. A postprocessing component is added to the compiler that
   extracts the names of the counters and creates initialization code
   for them. (See desing/postprocess.r)

   Generated transformers print profiling information to stderr
   including the application count for each rule. (Future work:
   make this information optional.)

Tue Oct 13 16:34:14 PDT 1998
 
 * Found bug in transformations for Case introduction. Now we have
   new stable compiler. This optimization gives 2 to 3 times faster
   components. The bug was caused by applying the Identity elimination
   rules (I) in the conChoice traversal without a default. Is now
   try(I). This is tricky stuff.

 * Refined the time measurements printing to include some decimals.

Tue Oct 13 14:21:28 PDT 1998

 * Bootstrapping protocol encoded in design/Makefile. Use make bootstrap
   to propagate modifications to the compiler.

 * Measuring performance and effects of optimizations on compiler itself.
   (See design/PERFORMANCE)

 * Extended peephole optimizer with rules for eliminating double labels
   for the same statement. Is currently not used, because not completely
   working. Does decrease code size, but probably not signicant for
   run-time. The problem is interesting as a paradigm for distributing
   information up and down the tree.

 * Guarded choices. Choices of which all branches with a MatchFun can
   be treated as a case statement. No need for using the choice stack
   in these cases. Once one MatchFun has succeeded there is no need
   to check the others. (Assuming the MatchFuns are disjunct.)
   As part of this transformation congruences are translated to a sequence
   of a function match and a congruence with wildcard function symbol.
   For this purpose introduced Case, CongWld and MatchFunFC constructs.

   (At this point there is some devious bootstrapping phenomenon that
   keeps this from working.)

 * Found a bug in definition of subs in subs.r. alltd(try(s)) is a vacuous
   strategy. This turned up in strategy definitions with arguments and
   multiple definitions. (The only place where substitution is used at
   the moment.)

 * Wrote a special purpose parser for ATerms. This works much better.
   There is still a problem with the performance of the ATerm writer
   that cause too many garbage collects. Probably wrong way of doing
   output. (See sml/)

 * There where some bugs in the run-time system. There were no asserts
   for overflow of the recursion and choice stacks. This made it difficult
   to detect these overflows, which showed up as overflows of the term
   stack.

 * Stack sensitive strategy for flattening a tree of nested block
   instructions into a single list of instructions. 
   (See design/ins-simplification.r)

 * Traversal strategies for list in design/list-basic.r

 * Renaming of SVars changed such that strategy macros with arguments are
   renamed as well.

Thu Oct  8 16:40:25 PDT 1998

 * Wrote a combinator parser for ATerms. This turns out to be a bad idea. The
   parser is terribly slow. Next experiment is to build an MLYacc parser.

Wed Oct  7 16:55:18 PDT 1998

 * Implementation of ATerms in SML. See sml/
   Datatype, parser and pretty-printer done. To finish input and output
   from file. Possible problem: maximum length of strings in ML. 

Tue Oct  6 20:43:51 PDT 1998

 * Combined the first four components into the frontend.
   The last two of these, desugaring and inlining, can fail if the
   the needed-defs transformation fails to find some strategy 
   definition.
 * Started experimenting with compilation of rules with multiple
   interdependent contexts.

Mon Sep 21 13:55:37 PDT 1998

 * Ported instruction pretty-printer to new ATerm library.
 * Described bootstrapping protocol in README

Mon Sep 21 11:39:38 PDT 1998

 * Created boot/ directory containing the generated C code for the
   compiler components. To create a compiler on any platform it
   is now sufficient to have gcc.

Mon Sep 21 10:47:24 PDT 1998

 * Bootstrapped the strategies compiler!

 * Debugged port of run-time system in rts/ 
 * Added a procedure to the parser that prints a makefile %.r.dep
   with dependencies for a module %.r. This file can be included in
   a makefile.
 * The directory xmpl/test contains small test specifications testi.r 
   that target various parts of the compiler. make test should succeed
   if compiler is correct.
 * Debugged specification of compiler.
 * Split optimization into simplification rules and more complicated
   rules. Only simplification rules are used currently.

 * Created first rule for peephole optimization of generated
   instructions.

Thu Sep 17 17:34:08 PDT 1998
 
 * Ported run-time system to work with new version of ATerm C library;
   in rts/
 * Adapted the trs-parser to the library rts/
 * worked a bit on presentation of specification in design/

(Some of the changes relating to the design before Sep 17 are logged
in design/CHANGES)

Mon Jul 13 14:09:57 PDT 1998

 * generalized syntax for imports to have list of imported modules

Wed Jul  8 23:28:50 PDT 1998

 * Changed the syntax of the strategy languages as follows:
   - sequential composition s1 . s2  is now  s1 ; s2
   - recursion rec x . s   is now  rec x(s)
   - rules and definitions no longer followed by a ;
   - an imports can have a list of modules instead of a single
     module

Thu Jun 25 19:16:31 PDT 1998

 * Almost bootstrapped the frontend component. 
 * Made makefiles more portable

Wed Jun 24 14:13:31 PDT 1998

 * Split the compilers into components: frontend, inline, optimizer,
   backend.
 * seq (new abstract machine implementation)
   Makefile creates libstrategy.a for use in gcc compiling generated
   c files
 * Extended contexts with optional name of traversal strategy to use.

Tue Jun 23 10:28:09 PDT 1998

 * Added literate programming convention to syntax of strategy language.
   Pieces of code are embedded in \begin{code} \end{code} pairs. A
   literate file should start with \literate. 

 ! There is a bug in ML-LEX:  backslash cannot be specified as [\\] or as 
   "\begin". This is apparentlyinterpreted as a control character. Solution: 
   use [\092], the ascii code of \.

Thu Jun 18 18:08:39 PDT 1998

 * Implementation of new abstract machine in directory seq
 - strategy.[ch] : implementation of the instructions
 - strategy-main.c : provides shell around the implementation of a
   strategy that reads a term from stdin, reduces it and prints the
   result.
 - terms.[ch] : some auxiliary functions on terms
 - debug.[ch] : some functions and macros for debugging

 * TODO
 - Implementation of primitives for arithmetic etc.
 - The environment is not saved before a choice. This means that some
  variables can become instantiated in a failing alternative and then
  not be restored to unitialized.
 - The environment is accessed by counting from the top of the
  stack. That is, a variable that is number n in the current scope is
  represented by the n-th element from the top of the environment
  stack. This schema breaks if the environment grows dynamically with
  recursion and variables from a scope outside the recursion are
  accessed inside it. For instance,
   {x, y: match((x, y)) . build(y) . 
          rec loop . ({t: ... . build(x) . ... . loop})}
 - Make stack sizes dynamic or at least configurable from the
  command-line.

 * Repaired some bugs in SML implementation:
   - added where around translation of application in build
   - added compilation of primitives for integer arithmetic
 
 * Repaired some bugs in old implementation in toc:
   - floating point error in profiling when duration 0
   - added implementation of primitives for integer arithmetic
   - _op versions of list_to functions for use in parser: a list
     usded in rewrite rule should be represented by means of
     Op("Cons", ...) not by Cons(...).
   - fixed a bug in the import mechanism of the parser

Mon Jun  8 16:25:00 PDT 1998

 * Started work on compiler from strategies to instructions. Based
   on local backtracking semantics of +
   The compiler embeds strategies (with some context information, i.e.
   continuation labels) into instructions. This embedding is refined
   by the compilation rules.

Wed May  6 16:36:53 PDT 1998

 * Todo: use direct calls to symbolic labels by &s1 instead of
   using the jump table. According to Andrew this is possible
   in gcc.
 * Added counting code in the generated C code. Counted are: number
   of matches, number of builds, number of rule application. Todo:
   profiling of individual rules in specification.
   This provides profiling information of the form:

	rewriting succeeded
	(11 seconds, 3949 steps, 359 steps/sec, 17721 bms, 1611 bms/sec

   Here bms are builds and matches.
 * Added garbage collection: After 10000 recursive calls the 
   garbage collector is called. This can be improved.
 * Function tuple_cong constructs a tuple congruences, but 
   distinguishes a singleton tuple. 
 * In encoding functions distinction is now made between TCons and "TCons".
 * Changed the parser to %pure mode.
 * Cleaned up the code for expanding imports. 

Mon May  4 17:01:15 PDT 1998

 * Solved the import problem. But not in LEX or YACC, this seems to
   be impossible. Instead I simply check the parse tree for a module
   and expand all Imports(file) structures by parsing file.

Mon May  4 10:17:41 PDT 1998

 * Parser for strategy specifications in LEX & YACC: trs.lx & trs.grm
 - problem: implement import mechanism; recursive call to the parser
   does not seem to work.
 * Restructured C implementation:
	strategy.h : macros & declarations for abstract machine
	strategy.c : functions for abstract machine
	main.c 	   : a main function for use with compiled specifications
	trs_parser.c : main function for parser
	debug.h/c  : macros for debugging
	term_aux.c : some functions for terms (list to cons/nil, etc.)

Thu Apr 30 18:06:28 PDT 1998

 ! The first version of the desugar and optimize pipeline works !

 * Implemented the primitive strategy str_gt for comparing strings.
 * Found out how to distinguish strings from functions: solved "Cons"/Cons 
   problem.

Wed Apr 29 17:12:31 PDT 1998

 * Debugged generation of new variables. Problem is not solved
   but it is now diagnosed.

Tue Apr 28 22:38:28 PDT 1998

 * Introduced single operator Prim(x) for nullary primitives such
   as new.
 * Replaced SApp by Label. Label can have arguments.
 * Removed term arguments to strategy operators (~t). Terms have
   to be passed on the term stack, for instance by building a
   tuple of all terms to be passed.
 * Changed definition of contexts: a topdown pass is done that
   replaces exactly one occurence of the context pattern.
 * Added definition of strategy application in term building (TApp) and
   translation of this to strategy (see contexts.sml)
 * Removed definition of copy from copy.sml; Only new is a primitive.
   Renaming of bound variables is done by a strategy. See the 
   library subs.r
 * Added merging of strategy definitions with the same label (and
   thus also rule definitions with the same label).
 * Added definition of kids: replace an application by a tuple consisting
   of the arguments of the application.
 * Updated grammar to the redesigned language: no term arguments of
   strategies, strategy application in rhs, tuple notation, kinds,
   rules in strategies now between << and >>, one, etc.
 * Continued with the cleanup operation; renaming mml into sml etc.


 * Implemented new and kids in C preamble: Kids translates the list
   of arguments into a tuple represented by TCons/TNil.
 * Implemented one like some

Sun Apr 26 13:02:38 PDT 1998

 * Starting to update the implementation to the new design according
   to the specification in design/
 * renamed all .mml files into .sml files
 * moved all interface files (parsing and stuff) into src
 * renamed fol.grm etc into trs.grm etc
 * introduced directory xmpl for example specifications
 * added ICFP paper to bibliography

Mon Mar 23 11:23:31 PST 1998

 ! I compiled the RML optimizer and ran it on the record example.
   It seems to work!
 * To do: we need a let construct to prevent code explosion.
   Can simply be compiled in the same way as recursive calls.
 * Fixed bugs caused by the transition to fall-through style;
   At many positions an explicit goto to success continuation
   is needed at the end of the code.
 * S(x) matching: A term S(t) matches with an integer constant i
   if i > 0 and t matches with i - 1.
 * When failing in a recursive call the failure should be handled by
   the caller in the same way as success is handled. Therefore, both
   the success and the failure continuation are pushed onto the return
   stack.
 * A mechanism for synchronisation of the choice stack and lchoice
   stacks was needed. The method now is as follows: on entering a
   lchoice (like operation), first a mark (a unique integer) is pushed
   both on the choice and on the lchoice stacks. When the lhs of the
   lchoice succeeds, all choices until the mark are popped. This 
   preempts backtracking under lchoice, where, test and negation. For
   the latter two this is correct, but for the first to this does not
   correspond to the operational semantics. But I don't know a better
   way at this point.
   An example is: where(A + B) . (fail <+ C)
 * Generate comments as part of the C code, for ease of identification
   of the results.
 * Changed many operations in the preamble from defines to actual
   procedures. To limit the amount of code presented to gcc.
 * Made the state global again. This might be a problem if independent
   strategies are compiled and need to be combined.
 * Introduced a variable debugging that indicates the level of 
   debugging desired.

Fri Mar 20 16:43:41 PST 1998

 * Cleaned up C preamble
 * Improved compilation of matching
 * Build is now done by calling individual Tmk functions for each subterm.
 * By default a compiled piece of code continues with the next statement
   on success 'fall through'.
 * Started definining signature for lists using polymorphic types in the
   style of ATLAS/MLS.

Sun Mar 15 17:52:16 PST 1998
 
 * Worked hard on implementation of compiler. Almost all constructs
   are done now. Still struggling with some bugs. The compiler is
   very straightforward and dumb at this point. There should be a
   large number of optimizations made. But as a first prototype
   it's ok.

 * Renamed Push into Where
 * Added new construct: Test
 * Compilation of almost all constructs, including:
   all, some, congruence, path.
 * Improved translation of left choice; a separate stack is
   needed to deal with it to get the commit effect; once the
   left part has succeeded, the right part should never be
   executed.
 * New and copy are translated, but not yet implemented in the
   C preamble.
 * For several constructs I added a more abstract definition
   of the translation. This is material for a paper.
 * Added environments to the state
 * Defined matching no longer by means of Tmatch, but by
   means of generated code. Is very crude now. Should
   be improved. But it does handle non-linear patterns
   and variables defined earlier.
 * Code for build reads values of variables from the environment.
   Can not yet handle int and string arguments because of <appl>
   placeholder, should be <term> but this is not provided by
   ATermLib
 * improved C datatype and its pretty-printer 
   (added construct for representing comments)
   am having troubles with the infix operators
 * new list function: find_index

Thu Mar 12 22:36:41 PST 1998

 * Started implementation of strategy to C compiler (toc.sml).
 * Got first strategy to compile and run in C.
 - Todo: environments and scopes in C + translation of
   several operators
 * Improved Tim's C pretty-printer a bit.
 * New list functions: split, iota

Tue Mar 10 23:04:08 PST 1998

 * Hand-compiled a small strategy expression to C with ATerms.
 * Borrowed C datatype in SML and a library for pretty-printing.
   This will be used to generate C code.
  (Installed Aterm library)

Mon Mar  2 12:31:53 PST 1998

 * Strategy functions can now have term arguments, e.g. in(~v, ~e).
   The constructor is Arg.
 * Renamed Eps into Id
 * Renamed Mu into Rec
 * Push takes a strategy. No more pop. Push 'copies' the current term
   applies the strategy to it and when successful throws away the
   term. Only the environment is kept. This is to express temporary
   computations, e.g. in conditions.
 * The functions that build the SIn(C(...)) strategy terms are now
   called C' instead of c.
 * Strategy substitution is parameterized with a strategy substitution
   -and- a term substitution. Implements instantiation of bodies of
   strategy definitions.
 * new list function: zipsplit.
 * Changed use of td_cata into more explicit definition doing the
   recursion explicitly. Less code.
 * Repaired broken definition of scope. Now all local variables are
   pushed on the environment stack before entering the scope and
   are popped afterwards.
 * Added wildcards in terms. Notation _ (underscore).
 * Added syntax for signatures. Types are terms. allowing a two-level
   (polymorphic) type system. No typechecking is done yet.
 * Added typechecking rules and strategy for the RML terms in rml.r

Fri Feb 27 00:19:34 PST 1998

 * Started to add push and pop strategies, implementation not yet
   ready.
 * Removed the general Pd strategy, because the boolean operator
   made strategies into an non-equality type.
 * Finished implementation of conditions. (But they should start with
   a push and end with a pop.)
 * Context terms can have a where condition, i.e. e[f where ...]
   in order to do some checking and intermediate computation in the
   local rewrite implied by a context. This introduces the problem 
   of strategies in terms. Therefore terms are parameterized with
   the notion of condition which is instantiated with strategies.
   Strategies are also parameterized with such a type variable. In
   this way strategies and terms have become a mutually recursive
   datatype. This complicates traversals: catamorphism-like functions
   have been extended with an extra function argument to apply to
   the condition parameter.
 * Hack: strategy substitution has a boolean flag that determines whether
   substitution should descend into terms embedded in strategies. This
   is necessary to defined strategy macros that are parameterized with
   terms. A better solution should be found, i.e. some kind of indication
   whether the argument is a term or a strategy. This is the reason for
   introducing the StratToTerm exception.
 * Added new example: rewrite rules for optimizing strategy expressions.
 * Changed the MakeStrMap function to deal with copies of the same
   subterm that introduce the same binding variable. The boolean flag of 
   the function tells it whether or not to look for the old new name for
   a variable or whether to generate a new new name;-)
 * Changed syntax of scope to {vars : strategy}, where vars is a list
   of variables. It may be necessary to make these variables also
   parameterizable.
 * Changed syntax of rules in strategies to <t1 -> t2 where s>.
 * Changed syntax of assignment in condition to s => t.
 * The problem with the s/r conflicts produced by [] is now resolved.
 * Adapted the RML example in rml.r to the new syntax. Still some bugs
   in definition (Inl1), probably due to need for push and pop.
 * The sources.cm files define which files the SML compile manager should
   read.

 (Working too late again)


Tue Feb 24 18:28:16 PST 1998

 * The file extension for specifications is .r because the language is
   called R, for really right rewriting.
 * Have added a simple syntactic inclusion mechanism for specifications.
   A declaration "imports file" has the effect that file is read at
   that position as a specification, i.e. a list of declarations.
 - (This entailed calling the parser inside the definition of the parser;
   to circumvent ML's module restrictions the parser is now parameterized
   with a function to call on imports. This is filled by a call to the
   final parse function itself, but because of recursion a fixed point
   has to be used.)
 * Introducing some new abbreviations:
   apply a strategy to a term: [s] t means build(t) . s
   match the result of applying a strategy: s -> t means s . match(t)
 * Conditions seem unavoidable. I have started adding conditions to
   rewrite rules. The idea is that a condition is nothing more than
   strategy expression. This entails a couple of changes in the
   syntax and in the interpretation functions. A rule is now written
   as 

		t1 -> t2 where c

   Here c makes typically use of the constructs introduced above, e.g.

   		t1 -> t2 where [s] t3 -> t4

 ! The syntax does not work yet because of the many shift/reduce
   conflicts caused by the overloading of [ and ]. So I'll probably
   have to find some other notation for application


Mon Feb 23 17:19:06 PST 1998

 * Made usage of structures local in all structures
 * Use = instead of streq
 * Renamed structure List into MyList to avoid confusion with SML
   library module
 * All strategies are defined in the interpreter. If an unknown strategy
   is encountered this is reported by printing a message.
 * The file rml.trs contains the rules for RML optimization.
   Contains notes about new features to add and alternative translations.


Mon Feb 23 10:21:11 PST 1998

 * Added strategy new(x) that binds the term variable x to a new string.
 * Introduced copy strategy. It always succeeds and replaces the root
   by a copy of the root in which all bound variables have been renamed
   to new variables. The copy function is a parameter of the evaluation
   function.
 * Introduced congruence strategies. Cons(s1, s2) will succceed on
   a Cons term if si succeeds on i-th argument. No new constructor has
   been introduced, but the SApp constructor is reused. A congruence
   strategy is a strategy function that is not defined.
 * Changed the scope constructor: it now introduces a list of variable names
   that are removed from the environment (undefined) when entering the
   scope. This allows for local scopes that inherit some variables and
   locally introduce some others. 
 ->When generalizing this we will probably wind up with a proper scoping
   mechanism using a stack with local variables. In the current scheme
   previously existing bindings can be destroyed by a local scope.

 * Changed constructor All into Alls to avoid confusion with the List.All
   function.
 * Changed use of @ for string concatenation to the standard ^.
 * Using = to test term equality.
 * Parser translates term lists [t1, ..., tn] to Cons/Nil lists to allow
   writing rewrite rules over lists. (No list matching is provided yet, 
   might not be necessary.) The function consnil_to_lst provides the
   backward translation.
 * Remove function on tables to remove all entries for some key.

Thu Feb 19 19:46:17 PST 1998

 * Added strings to the language and datatype of terms.
 -> todo: remove double-quotes after parsing

 * Added copy.sml for making copies of terms with new variables;
   using the module gensym from the metasml implementation
 * Added constructors All and Some for strategies. This allows
   to pretty-print these operators (Pd(f,s) with f a function can
   not be pretty-printed; it is also not possible to determine which
   operator it was originally.) I will remove Pd from the abstract
   syntax and only use it as an implementation notion.
 * Added pretty-printer for strategies. (all pretty-printers are non
   pretty, i.e. only generate a flat string)
 * Fixed bug in foldr1
 * Removed structure Absyn from parser; just open all modules needed
   for abstract syntax
 
 ! Warning: introduced function All in List and constructor All in
   Strategies.

Tue Feb 17 20:00:49 PST 1998

 * updated documentation of the SML program. Make in src will give you
   Doc.dvi
 * Put all list functions in lists.mml
 * Reorganized some functions, i.e. closer to definition of the main
   datatype they work on.
 * There is now a function |rewrite| that applies a strategy to a term
   given the term, the strategy and a list of strategy definitions.
 * Cleaned up the grammar files

Tue Feb 17 17:31:37 PST 1998

 * Added the following basic strategies:
    Match(t) : succeeds if the term t is matched, it extends the substitution
        for variables introduced in t
    Build(t) : succeeds and replaces the term by the instantiation of term t
    SRule(t1, t2) : anonymous rewrite rule, synonymous with Label(l), where
        l is defined as l : t1 -> t2

 * Added the following composite strategy combinator:
    Neg(s) : succeed if s fails and vice versa

 * The notion of top-down catamorphism replaces the problematic strat_x_map:
   td_strat_cata (and similarly td_term_cata) takes a test and two functions
   phi1 and phi2; the first is applied if test yields true the second if
   test yields false; in the latter case the cata is applied recursively
   to the children first.

 * The file contexts.mml defines the replacement of contexts in rewrite
   rules. See the file for an explanation.
